//! What decoding one response costs in allocations.
//!
//! The budget is stated in dhat's `total_blocks` and `total_bytes` deltas, and
//! it is measured on the identical decodes after one warm-up of the same
//! shape, exactly as the encode budget is: [`support::RUNS`] of them, held to
//! the stable minimum, for the reason `support` gives.
//!
//! The fixture is the upstream `RESULT` (three answers: a noul, a choice, a
//! score). Every block it costs is one the answer representation asks for -
//! decoding it into a fully borrowed type costs none - so the count below is a
//! count of `Vec`s and of strings too long to be stored inline. The names (the
//! model, the question names, the choice's pick and option names) are stored
//! inline up to 24 bytes on a 64-bit target, and every name in the fixture is
//! shorter; the level descriptions are `Content`, which owns a `String`:
//!
//! | item | blocks |
//! | --- | ---: |
//! | model name (inline) | 0 |
//! | answers vector, sized from the question count | 1 |
//! | three question names (inline) | 0 |
//! | the choice's pick (inline) | 0 |
//! | the choice's probabilities vector | 1 |
//! | the choice's two option names (inline) | 0 |
//! | the score's legend vector | 1 |
//! | the score's three level descriptions | 3 |
//! | the score's probabilities vector | 1 |
//! | **total** | **7** |
//!
//! One profiler exists per process, so all of it runs in a single test.
