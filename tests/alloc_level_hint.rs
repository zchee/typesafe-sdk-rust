//! What a response keeps in memory when the questions asked a large score and
//! the server answers with many small ones.
//!
//! A request passes the largest level count of its score questions to the
//! decoder, which starts a score's level lists at that capacity. The count is
//! the caller's, but the answers are the server's: nothing stops a response
//! from carrying far more score answers than were asked, each with fewer
//! levels than the hint. This test asks one score of 1,000 levels and answers
//! it with a flood of score answers whose legend and probabilities are empty
//! or hold one level, and holds what the decoded response keeps to a small
//! multiple of what the SAME body keeps when the request gives no hint at all
//! (a question set without a score). Without a hint the decoder sizes every
//! list from what it reads, as it did before the hint existed, so that is the
//! baseline an unbounded hint is measured against.
//!
//! "Keeps" is measured as the bytes freed when the response is dropped: every
//! block the response owns is freed then, and nothing else is, because the
//! body it keeps is a reference to the transport's buffer rather than a copy.
//!
//! One profiler exists per process, so all of it runs in a single test.
