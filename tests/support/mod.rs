//! Allocation counting shared by the `alloc_*` tests.
//!
//! dhat's `HeapStats` counts the allocations of every thread in the process,
//! and a measurement is the change in those counters across a section. The
//! test's own thread is not the only one: libtest runs a test on a thread it
//! spawns, and right after the spawn its main thread allocates its own
//! bookkeeping, once per process (rustc 1.98.1 `library/test/src/lib.rs`
//! lines 460-463: `running_tests.insert(..)` and `timeout_queue.push_back(..)`,
//! then it waits in `rx.recv_timeout`). nextest runs every test in a process
//! of its own, but that process is the same libtest binary, so it does the
//! same. On an idle machine that bookkeeping is done before the test measures
//! anything. On a loaded one the main thread can be descheduled between the
//! spawn and those allocations, and they land in whatever section the test
//! is measuring: 4 blocks and 900 bytes on Linux x86_64, seen as 4 failures
//! in 31 rounds of the suite pinned to 4 CPUs, and once in CI.
//!
//! So each asserted section is measured [`RUNS`] times, after the caller's
//! warm-up, and the budget is held against the minimum. Another thread can
//! only add to a process-wide count, never take from it, and the SDK's cost
//! of a repeated identical call is the same every time by design, so the
//! minimum is that cost. The minimum alone would also hide an allocation the
//! SDK makes in some calls and not in others, so it has to be the value of
//! at least [`AGREE`] of the runs: the foreign bookkeeping happens once, and
//! its two allocations can pollute at most two runs even if they fall on
//! either side of a run boundary. Every run is printed, so a polluted one is
//! visible in the output.
