//! What one request body costs in allocations.
//!
//! The budget is stated in dhat's `total_blocks` and `total_bytes` deltas
//! rather than in live bytes, because every re-allocation is charged as one
//! block whose byte contribution is the full new size - which is exactly what
//! makes a buffer that grows inside a call visible here.
//!
//! Everything is measured after one warm-up call of the same shape. The
//! first call of a shape fills the thread's encode scratch; the SDK's steady
//! state is what follows it. Each asserted section is measured
//! [`support::RUNS`] times and held to the stable minimum, for the reason
//! `support` gives: libtest's own thread can allocate inside a section.
//!
//! One profiler exists per process, so all of it runs in a single test.
