//! The environment variables a client reads, the request and response headers

//! URL, the per-attempt deadline and the response size cap. They live in one
//! module because they are the crate's contract with the outside world: a

//! knows in one place, and a change to one of them is a change to that
//! contract rather than an edit somewhere in the middle of a request builder.
