//! What a call answers with.
//!
//! The response type is generic in its answers from the start, so the map of
//! answers a runtime question set produces and the struct a derived one
//! produces are the same type at different parameters rather than two types
//! that drift apart.
//!
//! The received bytes are kept beside the decoded answers. An answer of a kind
//! this version does not model is dropped by the decoder and is still there in
//! the raw body, so a caller is never left with no way to read what the server
//! actually said.
//!
//! Every container keeps the order that means something: the answers and a
//! choice's probabilities are in the order the server sent them, which is the
//! order the caller asked in, while a score's legend and probabilities are
//! sorted by level, so two responses that differ only in the order of a score's
//! keys compare equal and print the same.
