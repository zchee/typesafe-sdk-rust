//! The seam between this crate and whatever sends the bytes.
//!
//! The SDK drives a `tower`-shaped service rather than an HTTP client, so a
//! caller can put their own stack underneath it - a recorder, a proxy, an
//! in-memory harness - without this crate knowing about it, and the default
//! stack, [`HyperTransport`], is one implementation of that seam rather than a
//! hard dependency. Any [`tower_service::Service`] over `http` requests with
//! this crate's [`Body`] is a transport; [`HttpService`] names the bounds.
//!
//! The request body is this crate's own type implementing `http-body`, not a
//! type borrowed from a pre-1.0 crate, so the public signature does not commit
//! a caller to a version of somebody else's dependency.
//!
//! A transport sends one request. Everything around that - the headers every
//! request carries, the deadline, reading the response under the size limit,
//! turning a failure into this crate's [`Error`] - happens here, once per
//! attempt, whichever transport is underneath.
