//! When a failed attempt is worth repeating, and how long to wait first.
//!
//! A [`RetryPolicy`] says which failures are repeated, how often, how long to
//! wait between attempts and how long one call may take in all. A client
//! holds one ([`ClientBuilder::retry`](crate::ClientBuilder::retry)) and a
//! call can replace it for itself alone
//! ([`SystemOne::retry`](crate::SystemOne::retry),
//! [`ListModels::retry`](crate::ListModels::retry)). The defaults are the
//! Python SDK's: two retries, a backoff from 0.5 s doubling up to 5 s with a
//! quarter of it jittered away, statuses 408, 429 and 500-599, connection
//! failures and timeouts, and 30 s for the whole call.
//!
//! The delay is a pure function of the attempt number and a random draw, so
//! the schedule can be asserted exactly rather than observed; the clock, the
//! sleep and the draw are a seam a test fills with a fake, so a retry test
//! costs no wall time and cannot be flaky.
//!
//! A server that says how long to wait is obeyed however long it asks for:
//! `retry-after-ms` or `Retry-After` replaces the backoff, and the backoff cap
//! does not apply to it. Retrying stops when the next delay would carry the
//! call past its budget, and the failure the caller gets is the last one,
//! unchanged.
//!
//! The loop is written here rather than taken from a crate. `backon` and
//! `tower::retry` were weighed and declined: the decision sequence has to be
//! the Python SDK's (which failures, then the server's delay or the backoff,
//! then the attempt count and the budget), the budget has to be measured on a
//! clock a test controls, the request body has to be shared rather than
//! rebuilt, and the loop must not box the attempt's future. Adapting either
//! crate to all four costs more code than the loop, which is short, and
//! `fastrand` supplies the one random number a delay needs.
//!
//! Nothing here spawns a task: the sleep between attempts is awaited inside
//! the call's own future, so dropping that future cancels the wait and sends
//! nothing more.

/// call with [`SystemOne::retry`](crate::SystemOne::retry) or
/// [`ListModels::retry`](crate::ListModels::retry). A policy given to a call
/// replaces the client's for that call only.
///
/// A failed attempt is retried when all of these hold, checked in this order:
///
/// 1. The failure is retryable: a [timeout](ErrorKind::Timeout) (unless
///    [`api_timeout_error`](Self::api_timeout_error) is off), a
///    [connection failure](ErrorKind::Connection) (unless
///    [`api_connection_error`](Self::api_connection_error) is off), or an
///    [API error](ErrorKind::Api) whose status is in
///    [`http_statuses`](Self::http_statuses) - or else the
///    [`predicate`](Self::predicate) says so. A request that could not be
///    built, a response that did not decode and a response over the size limit
///    are never retryable on their own; only the predicate can ask for them.
/// 2. Fewer than [`max_retries`](Self::max_retries) retries have been made.
/// 3. The wait before the next attempt, added to the time the call has
///    already taken, stays below the [`timeout`](Self::timeout) budget.
///
/// The wait is what the server asked for in `retry-after-ms` or

/// on and the failure carries one, however long that is. Otherwise it is the
/// backoff: [`backoff_initial`](Self::backoff_initial) doubled once per
/// attempt up to [`backoff_max`](Self::backoff_max), less a random share of up
/// to [`backoff_jitter`](Self::backoff_jitter) of it, in whole milliseconds.
