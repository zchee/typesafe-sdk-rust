//! Async Rust SDK for the [TypeSafe AI](https://typesafe.ai) API.
//!
//! The crate is published as `typesafe-sdk-rust` because `typesafe-sdk` is
//! already taken on crates.io; the library it builds is `typesafe_sdk`, so
//! callers write `use typesafe_sdk::...`.
//!
//! # Asking questions
//!
//! A call asks a set of named questions about a state. The set is built once,
//! validated and serialized by [`Questions::prepare`], and the resulting
//! [`PreparedQuestions`] is reused by every call that asks it. A [`Client`]
//! sends it: [`Client::system_one`] makes a request, whose methods set the
//! model, the deadline, extra headers and extra body members, and
//! [`send`](SystemOne::send) sends it and decodes the answers.
//!
//! ```
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! use typesafe_sdk::{Choice, Client, Noul, Questions, Score};
//!
//! let questions = Questions::new()
//!     .noul("billing", Noul::new().instructions("Is this about billing?"))
//!     .choice("tone", Choice::new(["calm", "angry"]).instructions("What is the tone?"))
//!     .score("urgency", Score::new(["can wait", "this week", "today"]))
//!     .prepare()?;
//! assert_eq!(questions.names().collect::<Vec<_>>(), ["billing", "tone", "urgency"]);
//!
//! // `Client::from_env()` reads the same settings from TYPESAFE_API_KEY and
//! // friends. Building connects to nothing.
//! let client = Client::builder().api_key("your-api-key").build()?;
//!
//! let state = "I was charged twice for one order.";
//! let request = client
//!     .system_one(state, &questions)
//!     .model("jev-latest")
//!     .timeout(Duration::from_secs(2))
//!     .header("x-team", "billing");
//!
//! // Sending needs a Tokio runtime; this example stops before it.
//! async fn ask(request: typesafe_sdk::SystemOne<'_, typesafe_sdk::HyperTransport, str>)
//! -> Result<f64, typesafe_sdk::Error> {
//!     let response = request.send().await?;
//!     Ok(response.answers().noul("billing").map_or(0.0, |answer| answer.noul()))
//! }
//! drop(ask(request));
//! # Ok::<(), typesafe_sdk::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! # Runtime requirements
//!
//! Every network operation is `async` and expects a [Tokio] runtime whose
//! **time driver is enabled** (`#[tokio::main]`, or a `Builder` with
//! `enable_time()` / `enable_all()`). Per-attempt deadlines and HTTP/2
//! keep-alive both arm timers, and Tokio panics when a timer is created on a
//! runtime without that driver.
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! The crate is `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`. Dependencies that use `unsafe`
//! internally are confined to single modules so that swapping one out is a
//! local change.
//!
//! [Tokio]: https://docs.rs/tokio
