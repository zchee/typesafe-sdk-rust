//! What a call can fail with, and how a failure renders.
//!
//! [`Error`] is the one error type every fallible operation returns. It is a
//! single boxed pointer, so `Result<T, Error>` costs a pointer beside `T`
//! rather than the size of the largest failure; the detail lives behind
//! [`Error::kind`].
//!
//! Three things here are not what a plain `thiserror` enum would do:
//!
//! * **An API failure's message is extracted from the server's body in a fixed
//!   order.** Servers put the human-readable sentence under `error`,
//!   `error.message`, `message`, `detail`, `detail.message` or a list under
//!   `detail`, and the SDK reads them in that order so the message a caller
//!   sees does not depend on which shape the endpoint chose. See
//!   [`ApiError::message`].
//! * **Nothing here prints a header value or a codec error's input.** An
//!   `Authorization` header and a decode error's excerpt of the body are both
//!   in reach of these types, and neither appears in `Debug` or `Display`.
//! * **Text the server chose is escaped and cut before it is printed.** An
//!   API failure's message and the request id are the server's text, and
//!   either would otherwise put a line break, a terminal colour or 16 MiB into
//!   every log line that prints the error. The accessors for the body and the
//!   headers still return them as they arrived.
//! * **`Retry-After` is parsed against a caller-supplied `now`.** Reading the
//!   clock inside the parser would make the HTTP-date case untestable without
//!   mocking time, so the parser takes the instant to measure against and
//!   [`ApiError::retry_after`] is the thin wrapper that reads the clock.
