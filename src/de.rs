//! Reading an answer set in one pass.
//!
//! The decoder walks the wire format directly instead of building a value and
//! then interpreting it: an answer's kind is known from the member that names
//! it, so the visitor that reads it can be chosen before its contents are
//! parsed, and a score's integer level keys become integers without a string
//! ever existing.
//!
//! The field path an error reports is built as the walk descends, which is why
//! a failure deep in the answers can name the field it failed at rather than
//! the object that contained it.
//!
//! JSON objects are unordered, so an answer's `type` may also arrive after the
//! members it governs. Those members are then held as the raw text they
//! arrived as - a slice of the response body, not a copy - and parsed once the
//! type is known. Reading them eagerly instead would fail the whole response
//! whenever an answer of a future type happened to reuse a member name with a
//! different shape, which is exactly the answer this decoder promises to skip.
//!
//! [`AnswerSet`] is the seam between this walk and what the answers decode
//! into: [`Answers`] reads them into a lookup by name, and a question set
//! declared as a struct reads each answer straight into its field.

///
/// # Contract
///
/// Every implementation, written by hand or generated, keeps these rules;
/// [`Answers`] and the struct example below keep them, and the tests of this
/// module hold both to them.
///
/// * **Input.** The deserializer yields exactly one JSON object, keyed by
///   question name. Anything else (an array, a string, `null`) is an error at
///   `answers`.
/// * **Order.** The members of that object may arrive in any order, and inside
///   one answer `type` may arrive after the members it governs. What a
///   successful decode yields does not depend on either order, except which of
///   two answers with one name is kept: the first in wire order, as the
///   repeated-answer rule says. Which path a failure names can depend on
///   order, as the next two rules say.
/// * **Wrong kind.** An answer whose `type` is not the kind the field holds -
///   including an answer that is not an object at all, or has no `type` - is
///   an error at `answers.<field>.type` whenever `type` comes before the
///   members of the field's kind, which is the order the API writes. A typed
///   field knows its kind before `type` arrives and reads those members as
///   they come, so when a misshaped member of the field's kind precedes a
///   wrong `type`, the error is reported at that member,
///   `answers.<field>.<member>`.
/// * **Wrong shape.** A member of the right kind with the wrong shape is an
///   error at `answers.<field>.<member>` when the kind is known as the member
///   arrives: always for a typed field, and for [`Answers`] when `type` came
///   first. [`Answers`] holds a member that arrives before `type` as raw text
///   and checks it once the type is known, after the walk has left it, so it
///   reports that failure at `answers.<field>`.
/// * **Two types.** An answer that names `type` twice with two different
///   values is an error at `answers.<field>.type`, whichever members it
///   carries; naming the same type twice is accepted. (Upstream lets the last
///   `type` win; an answer that contradicts itself is refused here instead.)
/// * **Repeated answer.** When the object names one question twice, the first
///   answer is the one the set holds. A struct keeps its field's first answer
///   and skips a later answer of the same name unread, as it skips an extra
///   answer, so the later one's kind and shape do not matter. [`Answers`]
///   keeps every answer it reads, in wire order, and every lookup returns the
///   first of them; it reads a later answer like any other, so one of the
///   wrong shape is still an error there. A body both accept gives both the
///   same answer.
/// * **Missing answer.** A field with no answer is an error at
///   `answers.<field>`, where `<field>` is the question's wire name (what
///   `missing_field` receives), not the Rust field's identifier. A response
///   with no `answers` member at all is an error at `answers` for every set
///   that cannot be empty: the method is then called with an empty object,
///   and whatever it fails with is reported as the missing member. A set that
///   can be empty, as [`Answers`] can, decodes to its empty value.
/// * **Extra answers.** An answer the type has no field for is skipped unread,
///   whatever its kind or shape, and is never an error. It stays in the raw
///   body. [`Answers`] keeps every answer of a kind this version models and
///   skips the others the same way.
/// * **Allocation.** Nothing is allocated beyond the storage of the fields
///   themselves: keys are matched where they lie, never copied into a
///   `String`, and no intermediate map or value tree is built.
/// * **Context.** The [`AnswerContext`] is a sizing hint. An implementation may
///   use it or ignore it, and the result is the same either way.
///
/// A type that does not implement the trait is refused where a response of it
/// is asked for:
///
