# Line coverage

Measured at commit `873f431` on 2026-09-24 with one merged report over both JSON
backends; every line number below is a line of that commit. The measurement ran
on macOS arm64 with rustc 1.98.1 and cargo-llvm-cov:

```sh
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR="$HOME/.cache/rust/target-main"
export CARGO_LLVM_COV_TARGET_DIR="$CARGO_TARGET_DIR/llvm-cov"
env -u RUSTFLAGS -u TYPESAFE_API_KEY cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml llvm-cov clean --workspace
env -u RUSTFLAGS -u TYPESAFE_API_KEY cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml llvm-cov nextest -p typesafe-sdk-rust --all-features --no-report
env -u RUSTFLAGS -u TYPESAFE_API_KEY cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml llvm-cov nextest -p typesafe-sdk-rust --features internals --no-report
env -u RUSTFLAGS -u TYPESAFE_API_KEY cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml llvm-cov report --fail-under-lines 85 --show-missing-lines
```

`--all-features` selects sonic-rs; `--features internals` selects the default
serde_json backend and keeps the allocation-test seam. Each instrumented run
passes 449 tests of the published SDK package. The separate arbitrary-precision
test run is not part of this coverage report.

The published crate `typesafe-sdk-rust` is held to 85% line coverage by CI's
`coverage` job. CI uses the same clean/two-runs/report sequence without
`--show-missing-lines` or the local target-directory configuration.

## Total

| Lines | Missed | Line coverage | Regions | Missed | Functions | Missed |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 4,500 | 176 | **96.09%** | 7,079 | 395 | 772 | 33 |

A line counts as covered here when any test executes it in any instantiation.
The summary reports 176 missed lines; `--show-missing-lines` lists 139 distinct
source lines that no instantiation reaches. The two counts use different
aggregation over instantiated code. `src/codec/backend.rs` is fully covered in
the merged report (14 lines); neither backend is represented only by the other.

## Uncovered lines

"Cheap to cover" marks a line a short test would reach.

### `src/__internals.rs`

| Lines | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 50-52, 124-130, 135-141, 146-151, 161-163 | Thin wrappers used by benchmarks and fuzz targets (`check_depth`, `decode_list_models`, `api_error`, `parse_retry_after`, `backoff_seconds`). Those targets do not run under this coverage command; the underlying code is covered by unit tests. |

### `src/client.rs`

| Lines | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 107-109 | `Client::from_env`, the wrapper around `builder().build()`. Environment resolution is tested through the injected lookup; mutating the process environment is unsafe in edition 2024 and is forbidden in this crate. |

### `src/codec.rs`

| Lines | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 473 | `Detail::Opaque`: the path-tracking pass accepted what the first pass refused. Both passes read the same text with the same type; no input is known to reach this defensive disagreement case. |
| 532 | `Segment::Unknown`, a map key the path tracker could not capture. No response type here has such a key. |
| 743 | Reusing one `Transcoder` value after its deserializer was consumed. Ordinary JSON serializers ask it to write once. Defensive. |
| 760-762, 993-995, 1016-1018, 1243-1245, 1382-1384 | `Visitor::expecting` messages not requested by the current fixtures. **Cheap to cover** for the string/key visitors with a foreign adapter of the wrong shape. |
| 772-774, 780-782, 796-798, 800-802, 804-805, 807-809, 811-812 | Transcoder compatibility arms for `i128`, `u128`, `Option` and newtype values. The selected JSON parser's `deserialize_any` does not produce these shapes. |
| 834, 839, 842 | Number-token transcoding: an extra token-map entry, or token text that fits `u64`/`i64`. The synthetic tests cover a fraction, a wide integer and refusals, but not these arms. **Cheap to cover** by extending the number-token cases. |
| 859 | Transcoding an empty object through the serde_json source. **Cheap to cover** with an empty `RawJson` object written through another serializer. |
| 1037-1040 | Owned bare-string raw-text input. The real serde_json owned capture uses `TextSeed::visit_string`, which is covered; this compatibility arm needs a foreign string adapter. **Cheap to cover**. |
| 1053-1055, 1057-1059, 1061-1063, 1069-1071, 1077-1079, 1081-1083, 1085-1087, 1089-1090 | Raw text requested from a foreign deserializer that directly yields `bool`, `i64`, `i128`, `u128`, `null` or `Option`. The direct `u64` and `f64` cases are covered. **Cheap to cover** for ordinary scalar adapters; 128-bit and option cases need adapters that produce them. |
| 1123 | A second entry after the raw-value token. Real serde_json raw captures contain one entry; a foreign token-keyed map can reach this guard. **Cheap to cover**. |
| 1252-1254, 1256-1258, 1264-1266, 1282-1285, 1287-1289, 1291-1292, 1294-1296, 1298-1299 | `Render` compatibility arms for negative integers, `i128`/`u128`, `Option` and newtypes. **Cheap to cover** for a negative integer; the other shapes need foreign adapters because JSON `deserialize_any` does not yield them. |

### `src/config.rs`

| Lines | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 252 | The resolved configuration's `Debug` field for `log_endpoint_host(false)`. The builder's field and the event output are tested, not this `Debug`. **Cheap to cover**. |

### `src/de.rs`

| Lines | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 893, 906 | Level-keyed probabilities on a choice, or option-keyed probabilities on a score. The answer type chooses the shape before reading it, or the members are held raw until it is known; these mixed states keep the match exhaustive. |

### `src/models.rs`

| Lines | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 56-58 | `Debug` for the `Models` resource handle. **Cheap to cover** with `format!("{:?}", client.models())`. |

### `src/name.rs`

| Lines | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 101-103 | An owned `String` supplied to `visit_string`. The JSON parsers supply borrowed text or `&str` on this path; a foreign adapter can supply an owned string. |

### `src/retry.rs`

| Lines | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 339 | A response-validation error carrying a retry delay and selected by a caller's predicate. **Cheap to cover** with a predicate test. |

### `src/telemetry.rs`

| Lines | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 278 | An event's elapsed time without a start instant (`-`). Every recorded timed event in the tests has a start. |
| 340 | Bytes that are not UTF-8 in a logged body, rendered as U+FFFD. **Cheap to cover** with a trace-level event fixture. |

### `src/transport/hyper.rs`

| Lines | Why |
| --- | --- |
| 182-184 | `Debug` for the default transport's response future. **Cheap to cover**. |
| 247-249 | A connect timeout mapped to `ErrorKind::Timeout`. Loopback connections are accepted or refused immediately, not left pending; the timeout detection is unit-tested separately. |
