# Optimization ledger

Every number below comes from a run made on the machine described under **Environment**, with the command printed
above the table that holds it. Nothing here is estimated, and no measurement was repeated until it gave a wanted
answer. Results that contradict the plan are marked **Contradicts the plan** and carry the size of the gap.

The plan is the port's plan, which is not part of this repository; identifiers such as AC-P1, R17, T0.1 and v3.5 name
its acceptance criteria, risks, tasks and revisions.

## Environment

| Item | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Machine | Apple M3 Max, arm64 |
| OS | macOS 27.2 (build 26B5086k), Darwin 27.2.0 |
| Toolchain | `rustc 1.98.1 (48a229cea 2026-09-01)`, `cargo 1.98.1 (797e8a9bc 2026-08-05)` |
| RUSTFLAGS | **cleared** on every invocation (`env -u RUSTFLAGS`); the login shell exports nightly-only `-Z` options and `-C target-cpu=apple-m3`, neither of which may influence a measurement |
| cargo config | `--config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml`, which only redirects `build.target-dir`; no profile overrides |
| Date | 2026-09-19 |
| Crates measured | sonic-rs 0.5.10, serde_json 1.0.151 (`float_roundtrip`), serde_path_to_error 0.1.20, dhat 0.3.3, bytes 1.12.1, json-escape-simd 3.1.2, divan 0.1.21, hyper 1.11.1, hyper-util 0.1.20, hyper-rustls 0.27.9, rustls 0.23.45, rustls-platform-verifier 0.7.0, tokio-rustls 0.26.5, h2 0.4.19 |

Measurement rules followed: no benchmark ran in parallel with another benchmark or with a build; no `RUSTFLAGS` and no
`target-cpu`; allocation numbers are taken on the **second identical call**, after one warm-up call of the same shape;
every dhat scenario is its own process, because dhat attributes the whole process to one profiler.

Reproduce everything from a checkout of the tag `v0.1.0` (`git worktree add ../spikes-v0.1.0 v0.1.0`), which keeps the
five spike crates this ledger names (`spikes/sonic-probe`, `spikes/encode-buffer`, `spikes/transport-probe`,
`spikes/alloc-inventory`, `spikes/deps-probe`); none of them is kept on `main`:

```sh
cd spikes/sonic-probe     && env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml build --release
cd spikes/encode-buffer   && env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml build --release
cd spikes/transport-probe && env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml build --release
cd spikes/alloc-inventory  && env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml build --release
```

The binaries land in the shared target directory that `config.dev.toml` names; the commands below write it as
`$TARGET/release/<name>`.

## Phase 0 foundation findings

Carried into the ledger so that a reader of this file alone has the transport and dependency facts the spikes build on.
These six were established in T0.1-T0.3.

| # | Finding | Consequence |
| --- | --- | --- |
| F1 | `hyper_rustls::HttpsConnectorBuilder::with_tls_config` asserts that `ClientConfig.alpn_protocols` is empty and aborts the process otherwise; it fills ALPN itself from `enable_http1()`/`enable_http2()` | the SDK's own `ClientConfig` must leave `alpn_protocols` empty |
| F2 | rustls-platform-verifier 0.7.0 has no `tls_config()`; the entry points are `BuilderVerifierExt::with_platform_verifier()` / `ConfigVerifierExt`, and `Verifier::new_with_extra_roots(roots, provider) -> Result<Self, TlsError>` | extra roots need the explicit `Verifier`, not hyper-rustls' own helper |
| F3 | The crypto provider must be named explicitly: `builder_with_provider(Arc::new(rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::default_provider()))` | a second provider entering the graph cannot make the process default ambiguous |
| F4 | A cold `http2_only(true)` hyper-util legacy client sent 50 concurrent h2c requests over exactly 1 accepted connection | the TLS `Auto` case was the open question S2b answers below |
| F5 | An rcgen self-signed certificate with SAN `127.0.0.1` works directly as a rustls trust anchor; no CA/leaf pair is needed | the TestServer needs one certificate, not a chain |
| F6 | `cargo deny check` is clean (advisories, bans, licenses, sources) for the workspace and for the full runtime set in `spikes/deps-probe` (a probe crate that is not kept: CI's `cargo deny check` covers the workspace's own graph); duplicate versions are warnings only (`syn` 2.0.119 vs 3.0.6, `getrandom` 0.3.4 vs 0.4.3) | `crates/macros` takes syn 3 in Phase 4 |

---

## S1 - sonic-rs semantics

Binary: `spikes/sonic-probe`. One scenario per process run.

### S1(a) `serde_path_to_error` over `sonic_rs::Deserializer`

```sh
$TARGET/release/sonic-probe a-path
```

| Case | Codec | `error.path()` | `error.inner()` |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `answers.spam.noul` removed | sonic-rs | `answers.spam` | ``missing field `noul` at line 1 column 101`` |
| `answers.spam.noul` removed | serde_json | `answers.spam` | ``missing field `noul` at line 1 column 101`` |
| `models[1].name` is the integer `123` | sonic-rs | `models[1].name` | `invalid type: integer 123, expected a borrowed string at line 1 column 99` |
| `models[1].name` is the integer `123` | serde_json | `models[1].name` | `invalid type: integer 123, expected a borrowed string at line 1 column 99` |

`serde_path_to_error::deserialize(&mut sonic_rs::Deserializer::from_slice(..))` compiles and tracks paths, and reports
the same path as it does over serde_json. Without it, the bare sonic-rs error carries a line/column and a three-line
ASCII caret excerpt of the input, but no path.

**Decision (plan section 5, S1(a) rule: "works -> use it on the failure path for generic `T`"):** use
`serde_path_to_error` on the failure path for generic `T`.

**Contradicts the plan, small:** AC-F6 requires ``field_path == "answers.spam.noul"`` for a missing `noul`. Neither
codec reports that: a *missing field* is reported at the containing struct (`answers.spam`), because that is where
serde raises it; the field name appears in the inner message instead. Both halves are available, so the SDK can render
`answers.spam.noul` by appending the missing field name from the inner error, but AC-F6 cannot be satisfied by
`error.path().to_string()` alone. Either the SDK composes the path, or AC-F6 is restated as
``path == "answers.spam" && inner contains "missing field `noul`"``. This is the next worker's call to make, in
`error.rs`.

**Open question:** the bare sonic-rs error embeds a multi-line excerpt of the input in its `Display`. For a `state`
carrying PII that excerpt would reach the user's logs. `codec.rs` should decide whether to render sonic errors
verbatim or to strip them to code plus position.

### S1(b) borrowed `&'de str` fields and integer map keys

```sh
$TARGET/release/sonic-probe b-borrow
```

| Target | Input | sonic-rs | serde_json |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `&'a str` | `{"s":"friendly"}` | `Ok`, points into the input buffer | `Ok`, points into the input buffer |
| `&'a str` | `{"s":"a\"b\ncé"}` | `Err invalid type: string ..., expected a borrowed string` | same error |
| `Cow<'a, str>` | `{"s":"friendly"}` | `Ok`, borrowed, points into the input | not measured |
| `Cow<'a, str>` | `{"s":"a\"b\ncé"}` | `Ok`, **owned** (the unescaped form is a fresh allocation) | not measured |
| `HashMap<u32, f64>` | `{"0":0.1,"1":0.9}` | `Ok {0: 0.1, 1: 0.9}` | not measured |
| `BTreeMap<u32, f64>` | `{"0":0.1,"1":0.9}` | `Ok {0: 0.1, 1: 0.9}` | `Ok {0: 0.1, 1: 0.9}` |
| `BTreeMap<LevelKey, f64>`, newtype whose visitor parses `&str` | `{"0":0.1,"1":0.9}` | `Ok {LevelKey(0): 0.1, LevelKey(1): 0.9}` | same |

`LevelKey`'s visitor implements both `visit_str` and `visit_u64`; both codecs took `visit_str`, so an object key
reaches the visitor as text and the newtype parses it.

**Decision:** score levels can be stored as integers without allocating, either through `u32` directly or through a
newtype visitor; both work on both codecs. Borrowing a `&'de str` out of the response body is available but only for
values with no escape sequences, so any field that may contain an escape must be `Cow<'de, str>` or owned. Zero-copy
answer names are therefore possible but not unconditional.

### S1(c) constant C for AC-P2

```sh
$TARGET/release/sonic-probe c-borrowed
$TARGET/release/sonic-probe c-ignoredany
$TARGET/release/sonic-probe c-owned
```

Fixture: the upstream `RESULT` (`tests/test_clients.py:42-56`) as compact JSON, 364 bytes. Second identical call.

| Target | blocks | bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Allocation-free borrowed probe (`&str`, `f64`, named fields, no `String`/`Vec`/map) | **0** | **0** |
| `serde::de::IgnoredAny` | 0 | 0 |
| Owned control (`String` + `HashMap<String, sonic_rs::Value>`), not a budget, only proof the harness measures | 8 | 1765 |

**C = 0 blocks, 0 bytes.** sonic-rs allocates nothing to decode a 364-byte document into a fully borrowed target, and
its skip path allocates nothing either, so the two do not differ. The owned control shows the counters are live.

**Consequence for AC-P2:** the budget `<= 14 + C` blocks is `<= 14` blocks. Every block in a decode is one the SDK's own
representation asked for; none is the codec's.

### S1(d) nesting

Each shape runs in its own process; the shell records the exit status, because a stack overflow terminates the process
rather than returning an error.

```sh
$TARGET/release/sonic-probe nest <shape> <depth> <stack-kib>   # stack-kib 0 = the main thread (8 MiB on macOS)
```

Depth 100,000, input `[[[...]]]` (200,000 bytes), and the same nested inside `{"legend": ...}`:

| Shape | main thread (8 MiB) | 2 MiB thread |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `sonic_rs::Value` | **SIGABRT, "has overflowed its stack"** | **SIGABRT** |
| `serde::de::IgnoredAny` through sonic-rs | **SIGABRT** | **SIGABRT** |
| `sonic_rs::OwnedLazyValue` | **SIGABRT** | **SIGABRT** |
| the same three inside a `legend` field | **SIGABRT** | **SIGABRT** |
| `serde_json::Value` | `Err recursion limit exceeded at line 1 column 128` | same |
| `IgnoredAny` through serde_json | `Ok` (its skip path is iterative) | same |

Highest depth at which the process still exits normally, found by bisection:

| Shape | release, 2 MiB | release, 8 MiB | dev, 2 MiB | dev, 8 MiB |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `sonic_rs::Value` | 9,409 | 37,120 | 43 | 175 |
| `IgnoredAny` (sonic skip path) | 8,785 | 34,649 | **24** | 97 |
| `OwnedLazyValue` | 8,784 | 34,647 | 24 | 96 |
| `Value` inside `legend` | 7,318 | 28,870 | 40 | 162 |
| `IgnoredAny` inside `legend` | 8,784 | 34,647 | not measured | not measured |
| `OwnedLazyValue` inside `legend` | 8,782 | 34,645 | not measured | not measured |

Stack consumed per nesting level, from the same bisection at four stack sizes (`IgnoredAny` shape):

| Stack | dev max depth | dev bytes/level | release max depth | release bytes/level |
| ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| 512 KiB | 6 | 87,381 | 2,232 | 234 |
| 1 MiB | 12 | 87,381 | 4,416 | 237 |
| 2 MiB | 24 | 87,381 | 8,785 | 238 |
| 4 MiB | 49 | 85,598 | not measured | |
| 8 MiB | 97 | 86,480 | 35,000 | 239 |

**Result: sonic-rs 0.5.10 has no effective recursion limit on any path the SDK uses.** Its serde `Deserializer` does
carry one (`src/serde/de.rs:23`, `MAX_ALLOWED_DEPTH: u8 = u8::MAX`), but `deserialize_ignored_any` calls
`parser.skip_one(true)` directly (`src/serde/de.rs:889`) and the `Value` and `OwnedLazyValue` paths have parsers of
their own, so none of the three passes through `with_depth_limit`. The failure mode is `SIGABRT`, not an `Err`: it
cannot be caught, and it takes the whole process, not the request.

**Decision (plan section 5, S1(d) rule: "if the skip path or `OwnedLazyValue` recurses without a limit, cap depth in
`codec.rs` and add a fuzz seed"): `codec.rs` must cap depth, and the cap must be enforced BEFORE the bytes reach
sonic-rs.** A depth counter inside a serde `Visitor` cannot help, because the overflow happens inside sonic's own
parser and the visitor is never re-entered. The workable guard is an O(n) pre-scan of the response bytes that counts
`[`/`{` against `]`/`}` outside string literals and rejects the body above the cap. The 100,000-deep array is a fuzz
seed.

**Contradicts the plan, large, and it constrains the test suite as well as the SDK:** in an unoptimized build - which
is what `cargo test`, `cargo nextest` and `cargo fuzz` produce - the skip path costs ~85 KiB of stack per level and
survives only **24 levels on a default 2 MiB tokio worker thread**. A fuzz target seeded with a 100,000-deep array, as
plan section 7 R12 prescribes, will abort immediately in a debug build; so will any test that decodes a document more
than ~24 deep on a worker thread. The depth cap has to be low enough to be enforced before sonic sees the bytes in
every profile, and the alloc/fuzz harnesses need either a release profile or an explicit larger stack.

**Cap decided: `MAX_JSON_DEPTH = 16`**, enforced by the pre-scan in `codec.rs`. 16 sits below the lowest ceiling in the
tables above - the 24 levels an unoptimized skip path survives on a 2 MiB tokio worker - so the depth the SDK accepts is
itself within reach of every profile, and the pre-scan's position ahead of sonic-rs is a second line of defence rather
than the only one. serde_json's limit of 128 was the obvious value to borrow and is rejected for that reason: it exceeds
the 24-level ceiling, so a body between 25 and 128 deep would pass the cap and still abort a dev-profile worker.

### S1(e) appending into a non-empty `Vec<u8>`

```sh
$TARGET/release/sonic-probe e-append
```

Starting from a 9-byte prefix `{"state":`, two `sonic_rs::to_writer(&mut buffer, ..)` calls and two literal splices
produced `{"state":"a \"quoted\" state","model":"jev-latest"}`, which serde_json re-parses into the expected object.
`to_writer` appends; it does not clear.

**Decision:** confirmed. The body splice of plan section 3.3 step 1 and the scratch buffer of S6 can both write through
`&mut Vec<u8>` (the blanket `impl<W: WriteExt + ?Sized> WriteExt for &mut W`, `src/writer.rs:138`).

### S1(f) float parsing

```sh
$TARGET/release/sonic-probe f-float
```

`f64::to_bits` of each parse:

| Literal | sonic-rs | `str::parse` | serde_json | agree |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `0.1` | `0x3fb999999999999a` | `0x3fb999999999999a` | `0x3fb999999999999a` | yes |
| `1e-7` | `0x3e7ad7f29abcaf48` | same | same | yes |
| `0.30000000000000004` | `0x3fd3333333333334` | same | same | yes |
| `5e-324` | `0x0000000000000001` | same | same | yes |
| `-0.0` | `0x0000000000000000` | `0x8000000000000000` | `0x8000000000000000` | **NO** |
| `-0` | `0x0000000000000000` | `0x8000000000000000` | `0x8000000000000000` | **NO** |
| `-0.0e5` | `0x0000000000000000` | `0x8000000000000000` | `0x8000000000000000` | **NO** |
| `-1e-400` (underflow) | `0x8000000000000000` | same | same | yes |
| `1e-400` (underflow) | `0x0000000000000000` | same | same | yes |
| `1.7976931348623157e308` | `0x7fefffffffffffff` | same | same | yes |
| 30-digit mantissa `1.234567890123456789012345678901` | `0x3ff3c0ca428c59fb` | same | same | yes |
| 30-digit integer `123456789012345678901234567890` | `0x45f8ee90ff6c373e` | same | same | yes |
| `1e309` | `Err "Float number must be finite"` | `inf` | `Err` | both codecs reject |
| `-1e309` | `Err` | `-inf` | `Err` | both codecs reject |
| `0.000000000000000000000000000001` | `0x39b4484bfeebc2a0` | same | same | yes |

The same divergence inside a document, not only as a bare scalar:

| Input | sonic-rs | serde_json |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `{"s":-0.0}` into `struct { s: f64 }` | bits `0x0000000000000000` | bits `0x8000000000000000` |
| `{"s":-0.0}` re-rendered through a `Value` | `{"s":0.0}` | `{"s":-0.0}` |
| `[-0.0]` re-rendered through a `Value` | `[0.0]` | `[-0.0]` |

**Result: sonic-rs 0.5.10 drops the sign of a literal negative zero.** `-0.0`, `-0` and `-0.0e5` all decode to `+0.0`.
The sign is preserved when the value reaches zero by *underflow* (`-1e-400` gives `-0.0` correctly), so the bug is in
the literal-zero path, not in the sign handling generally. Both codecs reject values outside f64 range rather than
returning an infinity, and agree on every other case measured, including subnormals, the 30-digit mantissa and both
underflows.

**Contradicts the plan, small but blocking for one criterion:** AC-Q3 compares decoded numbers with serde_json
`float_roundtrip` by `f64::to_bits` and names `-0.0` as one of the generated forms. That comparison fails today. The
next worker must add negative zero to AC-Q3's enumerated list of accepted divergences, or AC-Q3 cannot pass. For the
API itself the impact is nil - `noul`, `confidence`, `score` and probabilities are never negative zero in a meaningful
sense - but it must be written down rather than discovered by a failing test.

## S5 - how dhat accounts for re-allocation

```sh
$TARGET/release/sonic-probe s5-realloc
```

A `Vec<u8>` grown through a ladder of sizes, with the pointer compared before and after each step:

| Step | blocks | bytes | curr_bytes | pointer moved |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | --- |
| `vec![0u8; 1024]` | 1 | 1,024 | +1,024 | n/a (fresh) |
| grow 1,024 -> 4,096 | 1 | 4,096 | +3,072 | yes |
| grow 4,096 -> 65,536 | 1 | 65,536 | +61,440 | yes |
| grow 65,536 -> 1,048,576 | 1 | **1,048,576** | +983,040 | **no** |
| grow 1,048,576 -> 8,388,608 | 1 | 8,388,608 | +7,340,032 | yes |
| `shrink_to(1024)` while `len == capacity == 8,388,608` (a no-op in effect) | 1 | **8,388,608** | +0 | no |
| `truncate(1024)` + `shrink_to_fit()` from capacity 8,388,608 | 1 | **1,024** | -8,387,584 | yes |

**Conclusion, in one sentence: dhat charges every allocator call, including a `realloc` that keeps the pointer and even
one that does not change the size, as one block whose `total_bytes` contribution is the FULL NEW SIZE rather than the
growth delta - so AC-P1's rule "bytes allocated during the call <= 1.25x body length + 64 KiB" does catch a
re-allocation, because a buffer that grows from n to m inside the call contributes m, not m - n.**

Two details the next worker needs: `total_bytes` of a shrink is the new size, not the old, so a shrink is cheap in the
byte bound but still costs one block; and `curr_blocks` stays at +0 across a realloc, so a budget expressed in
`curr_blocks` would not see re-allocation at all.

---

## S6 - body encode buffer

Binary: `spikes/encode-buffer`. Body shape
`{"state":<state>,"model":"jev-latest","questions":<297 bytes of pre-serialized JSON>}`. States: English-like text with
straight quotes, newlines and multi-byte characters (`é`, `€`, `—`) at 1 KB / 64 KB / 1 MB, and an object
`{"subject": <64 B>, "body": <1 MB>}`.

### Variants

| Name | Strategy |
| --- | --- |
| `i` | one fresh `Vec<u8>` per call, pre-sized from the previous call's post-encode `capacity()` |
| `ii` | exact-size two-pass: measure the escaped length, allocate exactly that, write once with a hand-written scalar escaper. Object states fall through to `iii` |
| `ii-simd` | `ii` with `json_escape_simd::escape_into` in place of the scalar escaper |
| `iii` | thread-local retained scratch, taken out of the thread-local (never borrowed across the caller's `Serialize`), decayed hint `hint = max(len, hint - hint/16)`, shrink to the `8 * hint` ceiling, then an exact copy into a right-sized body buffer |
| `iii-1shot` | `iii`, but the shrink goes in ONE step down to `hint` instead of down to the ceiling |
| `iv` | `ii` for string states, `iii` for object states |
| `iv-1shot` | `ii` for string states, `iii-1shot` for object states |

### Correctness first

```sh
$TARGET/release/encode-buffer verify
```

All seven variants produce byte-identical bodies for all four states. The scalar escaper's output equals
`sonic_rs::to_string` for the English-like filler and for `"`, `\`, `/`, every control character in
U+0000-U+001F, U+007F (DEL), U+00A0 (no-break space), U+2028 (line separator), U+2029 (paragraph separator),
the astral character U+1F600 and the non-ASCII sample `é€—` (U+00E9, U+20AC, U+2014); `escaped_len` predicts the
exact written length in every case. `json_escape_simd` also matches sonic-rs byte for byte.

Those characters are named in notation rather than written out: the corpus itself lives in
`spikes/encode-buffer/src/main.rs`, and putting raw control bytes in a Markdown file turns it into something
`file` calls data, git diffs as binary and grep skips.

### `json-escape-simd`: can it write into a caller-provided buffer?

**Yes, but not into an exactly-sized one, which is what variant (ii) needs.** `escape_into(value, dst)` appends to a
caller `Vec<u8>`, but its first statement is `dst.reserve(value.len() * 6 + 32 + 3)`, because its SIMD kernels perform
speculative full-register stores past the logical end (escape-simd 0.1.0 `src/json.rs:18-25`, with that reasoning in
its own comment). That is the same `len * 6 + 35` reservation the variant exists to avoid, so the crate cannot serve as
an exact-size escaper. It is measured below to show that, not because it can work.

### Variant x state, second identical call

```sh
for v in i ii ii-simd iii iii-1shot iv iv-1shot; do
  for s in s1k s64k s1m obj1m; do $TARGET/release/encode-buffer variant "$v" "$s"; done
done
```

`iii-1shot` and `iv-1shot` are identical to `iii` and `iv` on a single repeated size; they differ only in the
mixed-size sequence below.

AC-P1 asks for `<= 2` blocks, bytes allocated `<= 1.25 x body + 64 KiB`, and retained scratch `<= 8x` the decayed hint,
for BOTH string and object states:

| Variant | blocks <= 2 | bytes within bound | retained <= 8x hint | meets AC-P1 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| i | yes (2) | **no**: 393,284 > 149,437 at 64 KB, 6,291,524 > 1,401,531 at 1 MB | n/a | **no** |
| ii | yes (1) | yes (1.00x) | yes (5.89x) | **yes** |
| ii-simd | **no (3)** | **no** (6.89x at 1 MB) | yes | **no** |
| iii | yes (1) | yes (1.00x) | yes (4.47-5.89x) | **yes** |
| iii-1shot | yes (1) | yes | yes | **yes** |
| iv | yes (1) | yes | yes | **yes** |
| iv-1shot | yes (1) | yes | yes | **yes** |

Variant `i` is the one the 6x reservation was expected to sink, and it does: the hint that tracks post-encode
`capacity()` removes the re-allocation (2 blocks, not 3) but the buffer it allocates is the 6x one, so every call
allocates ~5.9x the body it sends.

**Contradicts the plan, and it is a defect in the rule rather than in the code:** the decay-and-shrink rule as plan
section 3.3 step 1 states it - "shrunk when it exceeds 8x the recent body size", with the hint decaying a sixteenth per
call - re-allocates the whole scratch **on every call** from the moment the condition first holds. In the sequence
above, variant `iii` allocates between 3.0 MB and 6.2 MB per 1 KB request for twelve consecutive calls, and it would
keep doing so for dozens more. The cause is that shrinking exactly to the ceiling leaves the capacity at the ceiling
while the hint keeps decaying, so the condition holds again on the next call.

Shrinking in ONE step down to the hint (`iii-1shot`) fixes it: one re-allocation of 775,406 bytes at call 5, then
1 block / 1,385 bytes for every call after it. The condition only becomes true again after the hint has decayed by
another factor of eight, so the number of re-allocations after an outlier is logarithmic rather than linear.

Variant `i` never shrinks at all: it keeps allocating 6,291,524 bytes for a 1,385-byte body indefinitely, because its
hint tracks `capacity()` and therefore never decays.

### Body-type conversion

```sh
$TARGET/release/encode-buffer bytes-convert
```

Second identical shape, for a 1 KiB and a 1 MiB payload (both sizes gave identical counts):

| Source | conversion blocks / bytes | first `clone()` blocks / bytes | second `clone()` blocks |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `Bytes::from(Vec)`, `len == capacity` | 0 / 0 | **1 / 24** | 0 |
| `Bytes::from(Vec)`, `len != capacity` (a codec-grown buffer) | **1 / 24** | 0 / 0 | 0 |
| `BytesMut::freeze()`, `len == capacity` | 0 / 0 | **1 / 24** | 0 |

**Confirms plan section 3.3 step 5:** the first `clone()` of a `Vec`-backed `Bytes` costs 1 block of 24 bytes (the
shared header), and skipping the clone when `max_retries == 0` saves exactly that. Handing over an exactly-full buffer
is free; handing over a buffer with slack pays the same 24 bytes immediately, whether or not it is ever cloned, which
is a second reason for the body buffer to be exactly sized.

### Wall clock (report-only)

```sh
cd spikes/encode-buffer && env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml bench
```

divan 0.1.21, timer precision 41 ns, 100 samples each, no RUSTFLAGS, run alone. Median of a second identical call:

| Variant | 1 KB text | 64 KB text | 1 MB text | 1 MB object |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| i | 187.2 ns | 9.415 µs | 152.9 µs | 152.7 µs |
| ii (scalar two-pass) | 1.853 µs | 115.9 µs | **1.874 ms** | 165.1 µs |
| ii-simd | 780.9 ns | 44.24 µs | 743.3 µs | 165.0 µs |
| iii | **187.2 ns** | **10.62 µs** | **165.2 µs** | 165.7 µs |
| iii-1shot | 187.2 ns | 10.58 µs | 166.7 µs | 165.5 µs |
| iv | 1.874 µs | 115.7 µs | 1.920 ms | 168.1 µs |
| iv-1shot | 1.937 µs | 115.5 µs | 1.939 ms | 165.5 µs |

No acceptance criterion depends on these; they are here because they change the recommendation. The hand-written
scalar escaper is **11x slower** than sonic-rs on a 1 MB string (1.874 ms against 165.2 µs) and **10x slower** on 1 KB
(1.853 µs against 187.2 ns); `json-escape-simd` is faster than the scalar loop but still 4.5x slower than routing the
same string through sonic-rs into a pre-grown buffer.

### S6 decision

The plan's rule: among the variants meeting AC-P1's bounds for both string and object states, the tie-break on this
macOS machine is bytes allocated per call, because instruction counts need Linux and valgrind.

Variants meeting the bounds: `ii`, `iii`, `iii-1shot`, `iv`, `iv-1shot`. **All five allocate exactly the body length
per call (1.00x), so the stated tie-break does not separate them.** The rule is therefore exhausted, and the
recommendation below rests on the next measurements in the table, stated explicitly rather than folded in silently:

**Recommended winner: `iii-1shot` - the thread-local retained scratch with a decaying hint and a one-shot shrink.**

- It is the fastest variant at every state size (187 ns / 10.6 µs / 167 µs / 166 µs), tied with `i` and 10-11x ahead of
  every two-pass variant, because the state string goes through sonic-rs' SIMD writer instead of a scalar loop.
- It allocates 1 block of exactly the body length per call, the joint best in the table.
- It needs no second escaper implementation. `ii` and `iv` require a hand-written escaper that must stay byte-identical
  to the codec for ever - the sort of thing AC-F7(a) already has to prove for the derive macro - and it buys nothing
  that `iii-1shot` does not already have.
- The `-1shot` shrink is a departure from the plan's wording and is required: see the mixed-size table.

Cost of the recommendation, stated plainly: `iii-1shot` retains up to ~6x the largest recent body per runtime worker
thread (6.29 MB after a 1 MB state), where `iv` retains nothing for string states. The decay plus the one-shot shrink
bounds that over time and it satisfies AC-P1's `<= 8x hint` rule, but on a 16-worker runtime a burst of 1 MB states
leaves ~100 MB retained until the hint decays. If that matters more than 11x the encode CPU, `iv-1shot` is the
alternative.

**Open question for the freeze worker:** an absolute ceiling on the retained scratch (drop it entirely when a body
exceeded, say, 256 KiB) was not measured. It would bound the retained memory without the 11x CPU of the two-pass path,
and it is a cheaper experiment than either variant here.

**No variant failed the bounds for reasons that implicate D2.** sonic-rs' 6x reservation is fully absorbed by a
retained scratch plus an exact copy, so the escalation clause of AC-P1 ("if no sonic-rs based variant meets these
bounds, execution STOPS") is not triggered.

## S2a - TLS, ALPN and extra roots

Binary: `spikes/transport-probe`. The live endpoint is contacted **without an API key**; 403 is the expected answer and
no credential is read, set or sent anywhere in this crate.

```sh
cd spikes/transport-probe && env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml build --release
$TARGET/release/transport-probe s2a
```

The client is built the way the SDK will build it: hyper-util legacy `Client` over a hyper-rustls connector
(`default-features = false`, features `http1`, `http2`, `tls12`, `aws-lc-rs`) with a `rustls::ClientConfig` of this
crate's own, `builder_with_provider(Arc::new(rustls::crypto::aws_lc_rs::default_provider()))`, the platform verifier,
and `alpn_protocols` left **empty**.

| # | Case | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `GET https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/models`, no `Authorization`, plain platform verifier | status **403**, version **HTTP/2.0** |
| 3 | loopback TLS TestServer, **no** extra root | handshake refused: `invalid peer certificate: Other(OtherError("“rcgen self signed cert” certificate is not trusted: -67843"))`; the server accepted the TCP connection (+1) and the client dropped it |
| 2 | loopback TLS TestServer, extra root = the server's certificate | status **200**, version **HTTP/2.0**, 1 connection |
| 2 | the SAME extra-roots config against the live API | status **403**, version **HTTP/2.0** |

Response headers of the unauthenticated live call, verbatim:

```
content-length: 118
content-type: application/json
date: Fri, 18 Sep 2026 19:06:33 GMT
server: istio-envoy
x-envoy-upstream-service-time: 7
x-typesafe-request-id: req_01a0b5e9ce0b7e9394746c6818917706
```

Body: `{"detail":{"error_type":"authentication_error","message":"Must supply an API key! Check your request and try again."}}`

**Decision:** the configuration works. ALPN negotiates h2 against both the live API and the loopback server;
`Verifier::new_with_extra_roots` ADDS to the operating system store rather than replacing it, which is what
`ClientBuilder::add_root_certificate` needs; and a client that has not added the root is refused, so the negative case
is a real check and not a silent pass.

**Stated explicitly: this proves `add_root_certificate` on macOS only. Linux and Windows remain unproven until CI can
run them**, and rustls-platform-verifier takes a different code path on each (`src/verification/apple.rs`,
`.../linux.rs`, `.../windows.rs`). The Phase 0 exit gate says "CI green on 3 OSes"; CI later closed that part of the
gate on all three.

Two facts worth carrying into Phase 2: the request-id header is spelled **`x-typesafe-request-id`**, and the 403 body
matches AC-F4's expected `error_type` and message exactly, so that criterion is confirmed against the live server
rather than against the documentation.

## S2b - cold fan-out connection count

```sh
$TARGET/release/transport-probe s2b
```

64 concurrent `GET` requests against the HTTP/2 + TLS TestServer, 10 repetitions, each repetition on a **brand-new**
client. The base URL is an IP literal, so no second socket is raced across resolved addresses. Connections are counted
twice independently: by the server at accept time, and inside the client by a connector wrapper whose counter goes up
when a stream is produced and down when it is dropped. The two counts agree in every row.

| Case | warm | min | median | max | client opened | live 1 s later |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| A: `Auto` (`enable_http1().enable_http2()`, pool default) | no | **64** | **64** | **64** | 64 | 1 |
| A: `Auto` | yes | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |
| B: `http2_only(true)`, ALPN h2 only | no | **1** | **1** | **1** | 1 | 1 |
| B: `http2_only(true)` | yes | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |

min/median/max are the connections the server accepted for the 64-way fan-out itself; "warm = yes" means one request
completed first, and then the 64 opened **zero** new connections in both modes. 2,580 requests were served in total
across the four cases.

The **minimum of case A cold varies between runs**: 64 in the run tabulated above, 3 in the lead's re-run of the same
binary (median 64, max 64, client_opened 64 in both). It depends on how far the first handshake gets before the other
63 tasks are polled, which is a scheduling race. The decision does not rest on it: what matters is that A's median and
maximum are 64 while B was 1/1/1 in both runs.

**Decision (plan section 5, S2b rule: "if `http2_only` yields 1 and `Auto` yields > 1, the default for `https` base
URLs is `Http2Only`, with `Auto` as the documented knob"): the rule fires exactly. `Http2Only` is the default for
`https` base URLs; `Auto` is the documented knob for HTTP/1.1-only proxies; `http://` base URLs always use `Auto`.**

Two details for Phase 2. Under `Auto` the pool does collapse to a single connection afterwards - 64 opened, 1 alive a
second later - so the cost is 64 TLS handshakes on the cold path, not 64 connections held. And AC-P4(c) is already
visible here: after one warm-up request, 64 concurrent calls open zero new connections under either mode, which is why
`warm_up()` is worth documenting before a fan-out even once `Http2Only` is the default.

## S4 - the server's HTTP/2 SETTINGS

```sh
$TARGET/release/transport-probe s4
```

Read twice from `api.typesafe.ai:443`, with no credential. First by writing the HTTP/2 preface by hand and decoding the
server's first SETTINGS frame off the TLS stream, which gives every parameter; then through the `h2` crate, which is
what hyper's HTTP/2 client uses underneath.

ALPN negotiated `h2` on both connections.

| Parameter | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| `SETTINGS_HEADER_TABLE_SIZE` | 4,096 |
| `SETTINGS_ENABLE_CONNECT_PROTOCOL` | 0 |
| `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` | **1,024** |
| `SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` | **16,777,216** (16 MiB) |
| `SETTINGS_MAX_FRAME_SIZE` | not sent, so the protocol default 16,384 applies |
| `SETTINGS_MAX_HEADER_LIST_SIZE` | not sent, so unlimited |

Immediately after its SETTINGS the server sent a connection-level `WINDOW_UPDATE` on stream 0 of **+25,100,289**, which
takes the connection send window to 25,165,824 bytes (24 MiB) from the protocol default of 65,535.

Through `h2`:

| Reading | Value |
| --- | ---: |
| `Connection::max_concurrent_send_streams()` | 1,024 |
| first `poll_capacity` grant on a fresh stream, after `reserve_capacity(16 MiB)` | **409,600** |
| `SendStream::capacity()` after that grant | 409,600 |

**Decision (plan section 5, S4 rule): neither branch of the rule fires, and nothing changes client-side.**
`SETTINGS_INITIAL_WINDOW_SIZE` is 16 MiB, far above the 1 MiB threshold, so there is no upload ceiling to document -
and it is the server's receive window in any case, which a client must not try to raise.
`SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` is 1,024, far above 100, so there is no fan-out limit to document either: the SDK's
own concurrency will be the binding constraint long before the server's.

One finding that is not in the plan's rule and matters for a large `state`: the 409,600-byte first grant is **not** the
server's window. It is `h2`'s own client-side send buffer cap, `proto::DEFAULT_MAX_SEND_BUFFER_SIZE = 1024 * 400`
(h2 0.4.19 `src/proto/mod.rs:47`), settable through `h2::client::Builder::max_send_buffer_size`. A multi-megabyte body
is therefore written in 400 KiB instalments as capacity is released, regardless of the 16 MiB the server advertises.
That is correct behaviour and needs no change, but it is the number to look at if a large upload is ever found to be
slower than the link allows - not the server's window.

**Keep-alive behaviour is NOT measured here.** Whether the load balancer counts an HTTP/2 PING as activity needs an
authenticated idle test.

## S3 - request compression

Date: 2026-09-19 (the server's clock read Fri, 18 Sep 2026 21:45 GMT). Made with `curl` against the live API **with**
an API key, taken from the environment variable `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` and passed on stdin, so it appears in no process
argument, file or output. Two API calls in total. The header name and scheme come from upstream
`src/typesafe_sdk/_core/transport.py` (`Authorization: Bearer <key>`); the request shape comes from the public
`https://api.typesafe.ai/openapi.json` (`SystemOneRequest`), and `jev-latest` is the only model name its documentation
gives.

The control body, 133 bytes, one noul question:

```json
{"model":"jev-latest","state":"I was charged twice.","questions":{"billing":{"type":"noul","instructions":"Is this about billing?"}}}
```

```sh
gzip -9 -n -c small.json > small.json.gz          # 133 -> 123 bytes; gzip -dc gives back the same bytes
# 1: control, uncompressed
curl -sS -o c1.body -D c1.hdr -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' --data-binary @small.json \
  -H @- <<< "Authorization: Bearer ${TYPESAFE_API_KEY}"
# 2: probe, the same bytes gzip-compressed
curl -sS -o c2.body -D c2.hdr -w '%{http_code}\n' -X POST https://api.typesafe.ai/v1/systemone \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Content-Encoding: gzip' --data-binary @small.json.gz \
  -H @- <<< "Authorization: Bearer ${TYPESAFE_API_KEY}"
```

| # | Request | Bytes sent | Status | `content-type` | `x-envoy-upstream-service-time` | Response body |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | --- | ---: | --- |
| 1 | uncompressed, no `Content-Encoding` | 133 | **200** | `application/json` | 248 | `{"model":"jev-1.13.0","answers":{"billing":{"type":"noul","noul":0.97}},"usage":{"input_tokens":276,"output_tokens":20}}` |
| 2 | same bytes, `gzip -9`, `Content-Encoding: gzip` | 123 | **400** | `application/json` | 2 | `{"detail":"There was an error parsing the body"}` |

Both responses came over HTTP/2 from `server: istio-envoy` and carried an `x-typesafe-request-id`
(`req_01a0b67bb15b7bf897a8b30fe716ec1f` for 1, `req_01a0b67bc5287b93844dc4fd8956daff` for 2). Neither response sent
an `Accept-Encoding` or any other header naming the encodings the server takes.

The status is **400, not 415**. The server does not say "unsupported encoding": it reports the gzip body as a body it
cannot parse, in a `detail` string that is not the `{"error_type": ..., "message": ...}` object the 403 in S2a returned.
Taken with the 2 ms upstream time against 248 ms for the control, this is consistent with the compressed bytes reaching
the application's body parser as they were sent, with neither the envoy proxy nor the application decoding them. That
reading is an inference from these two responses; the server's configuration was not inspected.

Step 3 of the brief (a 64 KB `state`, compressed) was **not run**: it applies only when the probe succeeds. The body
for it had been built - 65,649 bytes, 404 bytes after `gzip -9` - so the saving the feature would have offered on a
repetitive `state` is known, but no server behaviour at that size was measured.

**Decision (plan section 5, S3 rule: "accepted -> opt-in `compress_requests(min_bytes)` enters Phase 5;
4xx -> recorded and dropped"): 4xx. Request compression is dropped.** No `compress_requests` knob is added, and the
client sends request bodies uncompressed.

Not measured here: `deflate`, `br` and `zstd` request encodings (the rule is about gzip, and one 4xx settles it for
the plan); response compression (`Accept-Encoding` on the response side), which is a separate question; and whether
the 400 would count as retryable - it is a 4xx the SDK must surface, and it cannot arise once the client never sets
`Content-Encoding`.

## AC-P0 - itemized allocation inventory

Binary: `spikes/alloc-inventory`. Every step of plan section 3.3 prototyped and measured on the **second identical
call**, after one warm-up pass of the same shape. The body encoder is not re-implemented here: the crate path-depends
on `spikes/encode-buffer` and measures the S6 winner itself.

```sh
cd spikes/alloc-inventory && env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml build --release
$TARGET/release/alloc-inventory steps
$TARGET/release/alloc-inventory decode
$TARGET/release/alloc-inventory verify
```

### Steps 1 to 5: request assembly

| Step | Item | blocks | bytes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| 1 | body encode, 1 KB string `state`, S6 winner (`iii-1shot`) | **1** | 1,385 |
| 2 | retain the body for retry (`Bytes::clone`) | **1** | 24 |
| 3 | clone the base `HeaderMap` (6 headers) | **2** | 656 |
| 4 | build the `http::Request` from a pre-parsed `Uri` (headers moved in, not re-cloned) | **0** | 0 |
| 4a | clone the pre-parsed `Uri` on its own, second time | 0 | 0 |
| 4b | clone a freshly parsed `Uri`, **first** time | **0** | 0 |
| 4c | clone that same `Uri`, second time | 0 | 0 |
| 5 | `BodyExt::collect` + `to_bytes` on a single-frame body | **1** | 128 |

The body was 1,385 bytes and the thread's retained scratch was 6,188 bytes afterwards.

Three of these were open questions and are now settled. Cloning an `http::Uri` is **free even the first time** - unlike
`Bytes`, it does not pay a shared-header allocation on first clone - so step 4 costs nothing at all once the body's
own clone is accounted for under step 2. The `HeaderMap` clone costs **2** blocks, which is exactly what AC-P6 assumed.
`BodyExt::collect` costs **1** block for its frame queue, which is also what AC-P6 assumed.

### Steps 6 to 8: decode

| Step | Representation | blocks | bytes |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| 6 | prototype visitor -> `Vec<(String, Answer)>`, single pass, order independent, pre-sized | **14** | 554 |
| 7 | naive comparator: `#[serde(tag = "type")]` answers in a `HashMap<String, _>`, maps throughout | **26** | 2,672 |
| 8 | derived typed struct (`Ticket { spam, tone, quality }`), the `#[derive(QuestionSet)]` shape | **10** | 275 |

The plan's three budget questions, all on the same codec and the same fixture:

| Question | Measured | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- |
| is (6) <= 14 + C blocks, with C = 0 from S1(c)? | 14 <= 14 | **yes, exactly** |
| is (6) <= 0.7 x (7)? | 14 <= 18.2 (the ratio is 0.54) | **yes** |
| is (8) < (6)? | 10 < 14 | **yes** |

The prototype's 14 blocks are the plan's own item list, one for one: 1 model `String`, 1 answers `Vec`, 3 question-name
`String`s, 1 choice `String`, 1 choice-probabilities `Vec`, 2 option-name `String`s, 1 legend `Vec`, 3 legend
`String`s, 1 score-probabilities `Vec`. `usage`, every `f64`, every score level and every probability key cost nothing:
levels are parsed from the object key text straight into `u32`.

**Warning for the freeze worker: (6) meets its budget with ZERO headroom.** One extra `String`, one extra `Vec`, one
`Box` in the answer representation and AC-P2 fails. The 0.7x ratio, by contrast, has room (0.54 measured).

### Correctness of the prototype visitor

```sh
$TARGET/release/alloc-inventory verify
```

Decoded twice from a document whose answers, and whose fields within every answer object, are in a different order from
the fixture, and which carries one extra answer of the unknown type `"prediction"`:

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| wire order: sonic-rs result == serde_json result | **true** |
| shuffled order: sonic-rs result == serde_json result | **true** |
| shuffled order yields the same answers, compared as sets | **true** |
| shuffled order yields the same answers, compared in order | false, by design (see below) |
| `model` and `usage` unchanged | true |
| answers kept from the shuffled document | `["quality", "tone", "spam"]` |
| the unknown `"prediction"` answer was dropped | **true** |
| answer count | 3, for 3 questions asked |

The visitor is order independent in the sense that matters: `type` may arrive after the data fields, and it does in the
shuffled document, where `probabilities` is read before the answer type is known. The score's probability keys are then
read as names and converted to levels at dispatch. That path is exercised by the shuffled document and costs nothing in
the measured case, where `type` comes first.

**A design point the next worker has to decide:** every container keeps **wire order**, so a response whose keys arrive
in another order produces the same pairs in another order, and two decodes compare unequal as sequences while comparing
equal as sets. Either the SDK sorts `legend` and the score `probabilities` by level when it builds them - cheap, at
most ten elements, and it makes equality and `Debug` output stable - or every test that compares answers has to
normalize first. This is not covered by any current acceptance criterion.

### Proposed frozen budget table

Proposed only, and superseded: the budgets as frozen are in the final AC-P1 / AC-P2 / AC-P3 / AC-P6 check below, and
as tightened under `compact_str` for names.

Every number is from the tables above, with the plan's rule applied: tightening is free, loosening needs a ledger entry
and the user's sign-off. Where a measurement left no headroom, the budget is set at the measurement and said to be
tight.

**AC-P1 - body encode, second identical call, variant `iii-1shot`**

| Bound | Plan as written | Proposed | Measured |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| blocks, encode alone | <= 2 | **<= 1** | 1 |
| blocks, including retaining the body for retry | <= 3 (2 + 1) | **<= 2** | 2 |
| bytes allocated during the call | <= 1.25 x body + 64 KiB | **<= 1.05 x body + 4 KiB** | 1.00 x body |
| retained scratch | <= 8x the decayed hint | **<= 8x the decayed hint** (unchanged) | 4.47x - 5.89x |

Carve-out that has to be written into the criterion: a call on which the scratch **shrinks** allocates one extra block
of at most the decayed hint (measured: 775,406 bytes on call 5 of the mixed sequence). AC-P1 is stated for a repeated
identical call, where no shrink happens; the shrink is bounded by the retained-scratch rule instead. Without this
sentence the criterion is ambiguous the first time a test mixes sizes.

**AC-P2 - decode of the 3-answer fixture**

| Bound | Plan as written | Proposed | Measured |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| blocks | <= 14 + C | **<= 14** (C = 0, measured in S1(c)) | 14, **tight** |
| bytes | not specified | **<= 700** | 554 |
| ratio to the naive comparator | <= 0.7x | **<= 0.7x** (unchanged; the ratio depends on serde's version as well as on ours) | 0.54x |

**AC-P3 - derived typed decode** uses fewer blocks than AC-P2: 10 < 14, confirmed.

**AC-P6 - full call through an in-memory service, second identical call, 1 KB string `state`, default retry policy
(body retained), no per-call headers**

| Item | blocks | bytes |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| body encode (step 1) | 1 | 1,385 |
| body retention for retry (step 2) | 1 | 24 |
| `HeaderMap` clone (step 3) | 2 | 656 |
| request assembly from the pre-parsed `Uri` (step 4) | 0 | 0 |
| `collect` frame queue (step 5) | 1 | 128 |
| decode (step 6) | 14 | 554 |
| **total** | **19** | **2,747** |

Proposed AC-P6 budget: **<= 19 blocks** above the floor of calling the same service directly with a pre-built request,
for that pinned scenario. The plan's own assumptions inside AC-P6 - "`HeaderMap` clone = 2, frame queue of `collect` =
1" - are both confirmed rather than assumed.

### Open questions this inventory does not answer

- The floor itself (what an in-memory service costs when called directly with a pre-built request) is not measured
  here; AC-P6 is a difference, and the subtrahend belongs to the Phase 5 harness.
- Every number is for a 1 KB string `state`. An object `state` adds the retained scratch of variant `iii-1shot` to the
  picture but not to the per-call block count; a 1 MB `state` moves only the bytes, not the blocks.
- `tracing` is off in all of these runs. A subscriber's own allocations are not part of any budget here, which matches
  AC-P6's wording ("no `tracing` subscriber").

## Allocation harness

### 2026-09-19 - libtest's own allocations in a measured section

**What flaked.** CI run 35416188952 on `6658076`, job `coverage`, step "Line coverage"
(`cargo llvm-cov nextest -p typesafe-sdk-rust --all-features --fail-under-lines 85`): exit 100, a failed test, after
63 s. The same step passed on `383e2fb`, and the uninstrumented `check` job passed on the same commit.

**Reproduced** on a Linux x86_64 host (Debian 13, 44 CPUs) at `6658076`, built as cargo-llvm-cov builds
(`-C instrument-coverage --cfg=coverage`, `--target-dir <repo>/target/llvm-cov-target`). Every test of
`-p typesafe-sdk-rust` ran in its own process, as nextest runs it, 4 at a time, each under `taskset -c 0-3`: 4
failures in 31 rounds x 390 tests. All four were allocation budgets, and all four had the same extra charge:

| Round | Test | Measured | Normally |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 11, 26 | `alloc_call` whole call, SDK's own | 23 blocks (the retained-body line 5 / 924) | 19 (1 / 24) |
| 25, 27 | `alloc_encode` 64 KB string | 5 blocks, 69,508 bytes | 1, 68,608 |

**+4 blocks, +900 bytes** each time. No timing-dependent test failed in those rounds.

**Root cause.** dhat's `HeapStats` counts every thread of the process, and each budget is a delta of those counters.
libtest runs a test on a thread it spawns. Right after the spawn, its main thread allocates its own bookkeeping, once
per process: rustc 1.98.1 `library/test/src/lib.rs` lines 460-463, `running_tests.insert(id, RunningTest {
join_handle })` and `timeout_queue.push_back(TimeoutEntry { id, desc, timeout })`, then it waits in
`rx.recv_timeout`. A nextest process is the same libtest binary running one test, so it does the same. On a loaded
machine the main thread can be descheduled between the spawn and those allocations, and they land in the section the
test is measuring. The SDK's allocations did not change; the budgets were sound.

**Method now used** (`tests/support/mod.rs`, shared by the four `alloc_*` tests):
- Each asserted section runs five times after its warm-up call, and the budget is held to the **minimum**.
- At least **three of the five** runs must equal that minimum in blocks and bytes.
- Every run is printed (`runs of <section> blocks/bytes: ...`).

Why this cannot hide a regression:
- Another thread can only add to a process-wide count, never remove one. The SDK's cost of a repeated identical call
  is the same every time by design, so the minimum is that cost.
- An allocation the SDK makes on every call raises all five runs, and so the minimum.
- One it makes on only some calls leaves fewer than three runs at the minimum and fails the stability rule.
- The foreign bookkeeping happens once per process, but it is several allocations over three calls
  (`running_tests.insert` +1, `timeout_queue.push_back` +1, and `rx.recv_timeout`'s own), +4 blocks / +900 bytes in
  all on Linux x86_64. Nothing in libtest keeps them inside one run: that they land in ONE run of five is an
  **empirical** bound (46 of 46 polluted windows below), not a guarantee. If they ever split across runs so that fewer
  than three equal the minimum, the worst case is a failed stability rule - a flake - and never a false pass, because
  a foreign allocation can only raise a run, never lower the minimum below the SDK's own cost.

What is not repeated, and why:
- `prepared()`'s first call is measured once, because only the first call is a first call.
- The mixed-size sequence of `alloc_encode` repeats as a whole, five times from an empty scratch, and each call of it
  is held to its own stable minimum. Its 1 MB line stays printed-only.

**The frozen budgets did not move:** encode 1 block per call; decode 14 blocks / 626 bytes (budget 14 / 700), struct
set 10 / 347; a call 19 blocks (18 without retry) above the transport's 3; `prepared()` 0 / 0;
`Questions::prepare()` 3 / 1,524. Every one of them, measured on this machine (see **Environment**) with the harness
above, was the same in all five runs.

**Proof** on the same Linux host at `cb57396`, the same instrumented, pinned, 4-at-a-time loop: **0 failures in
35 rounds x 390 tests**. The alloc tests ran with `--nocapture`, 140 runs of them in all. **46 windows** had one
polluted run, never two, and it always carried the same +4 blocks / +900 bytes, e.g. `whole call 22/3405 26/4305
22/3405 22/3405 22/3405`. That is more than the four failures before because every section now runs five times, so
the process's one foreign charge has more windows to land in. The minimum filtered every one of them. One
platform difference, not a pollution: the naive comparator's bytes are 2,704 on Linux x86_64 against 2,672 on the
M3, the same 26 blocks.

## Phase 5 - performance

Everything below was measured at the commit its table names; the final tables are at `fd22977`. Nothing was run
while another benchmark or a build of this checkout ran.

### Environment

| Item | macOS | Linux |
| --- | --- | --- |
| CPU | Apple M3 Max, arm64, 16 cores | Intel Xeon Platinum 8481C, x86_64, 44 vCPUs (AVX2, AVX-512F) |
| OS | macOS 27.2, Darwin 27.2.0 | Debian 13.7, kernel 6.12.105+deb13-cloud-amd64, glibc 2.41 |
| Toolchain | rustc 1.98.1 (`rust-toolchain.toml`) | rustc 1.98.1 (`rust-toolchain.toml`) |
| Bench crates | `codspeed-divan-compat` 5.0.2 (its walltime layer is a divan 0.1 fork) | the same |
| Instruction counts | - | valgrind 3.24.0 (callgrind), cargo-codspeed 5.0.1 |
| Load while measuring | **not idle**: other sessions' test binaries held about 3 of 16 cores; load average 8-15 | idle apart from these runs (load average under 2) |

`RUSTFLAGS` was cleared on every run and no `target-cpu` was set, so sonic-rs ran its default SIMD level (SSE2
baseline on x86_64, NEON on arm64): the numbers are those of a consumer's default build. The macOS wall-clock numbers
carry the load above and are report-only; the Linux instruction counts are the reference.

### Method

Wall clock (divan, 100 samples, median shown; `loopback` 50 samples), `bench` profile without the dev config:

```sh
env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo bench --all-features --bench sdk         # macOS
env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo bench --all-features --bench loopback
taskset -c 2 cargo bench --all-features --bench sdk             # Linux, pinned to one core
cargo bench --all-features --bench loopback                     # Linux, not pinned: it needs both runtimes' threads
```

Instruction counts are callgrind `Ir`, the instruction component of CodSpeed's simulation, taken without CodSpeed's
runner (which is installed by its GitHub action and is not on the host), a token, an account or an upload.
`cargo codspeed build` produces the instrumented binary; valgrind's callgrind runs it with instrumentation off, and
each benchmark switches it on and off around its own measured call through `codspeed`'s client requests and dumps its
counts under its own name:

```sh
cargo codspeed build -m simulation -p typesafe-sdk-rust --features internals --bench sdk
CODSPEED_ENV=local CODSPEED_CARGO_WORKSPACE_ROOT=$PWD taskset -c 2 \
  valgrind --tool=callgrind --instr-atstart=no --compress-strings=no \
  --callgrind-out-file=out.%p target/codspeed/analysis/typesafe-sdk-rust/sdk
callgrind_annotate out.<pid>.<n>          # PROGRAM TOTALS, one dump per benchmark
```

callgrind writes `summary: 0` into these dumps (the header is computed before instrumentation is toggled);
`callgrind_annotate` recomputes the total from the cost lines. Every configuration was run three to five times.

`Ir` is not what CodSpeed reports. Its runner (`CodSpeedHQ/codspeed`, `src/executor/valgrind/measure.rs`) runs its
own valgrind with cache simulation (`--cache-sim=yes --I1=32768,8,64 --D1=32768,8,64 --LL=8388608,16,64`) and, since
the action's `cycle-estimation` defaults to on, `--cycle-estimation=yes`, and reports an estimated time in which cache
misses weigh heavily: each benchmark runs once, on cold caches. The verifier (`p5-verify`, report of the Phase 5 exit
gate) re-ran the whole-call pair with the same cache flags on stock valgrind (which has no cycle estimation), three
runs at `acd4df3`:

| Event | `call::sdk` | `call::naive` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| Ir | 33,908 | 65,347 |
| I1mr | 1,073 | 1,320 |
| D1mr | 203 | 308 |
| D1mw | 263 | 241 |
| ILmr | 1,030 | 1,229 |
| DLmr | 199 | 289 |
| DLmw | 261 | 238 |

The SDK is lower in every class except write misses, higher there by 22 to 23 events, against 31,000 fewer
instructions and 200 fewer instruction misses in the last-level cache: the comparison holds under any plausible
weighting of the events.

**Run-to-run spread**, five runs at `acd4df3` on the Linux host (min-max, as a share of the min). It comes from
malloc's state, which depends on the order the benchmarks ran in, so a benchmark that allocates in its measured call
is not exactly repeatable; only those at 0.0% are:

| Benchmark | Spread | Benchmark | Spread |
| --- | ---: | --- | ---: |
| `assembly::request` | **20.4%** | `decode::typed` | 0.0% (22,982 each run) |
| `assembly::header_map_clone` | 0.0% | `decode::codec::sonic_rs[3]` / `[20]` | 0.0% / 1.1% |
| `call::floor` | 0.0% | `decode::codec::serde_json[3]` / `[20]` | 0.0% / 0.1% |
| `call::sdk` / `sdk_20` | 1.6% / 0.4% | `encode::prepared[1024]` / `[65536]` / `[1048576]` | 1.9% / 0.0% / 0.0% |
| `call::naive` / `naive_20` | 2.4% / 0.5% | `encode::unprepared[1024]` / `[65536]` / `[1048576]` | 1.6% / 0.1% / 0.0% |
| `decode::answers[3]` | 3.1% | `encode::object_1mb`, `mixed_sizes`, `encode::codec::*` | 0.0% |
| `decode::answers[20]` | 0.6% | `retry::*` | 0.0% |

The verifier's own five runs at the same commit agree in kind: `answers[3]` 23,219-23,611 (1.7%), `call::sdk`
33,890-34,891 (2.95%), `assembly::request` 5,258-6,365 (21%). The five runs at `0303980` this section first
reported (0.0% for every decode) were narrower than both: `answers[*]` is not deterministic, `typed` is. A rebuild
alone also moves some counts by up to about 1% without any change to their code (code layout): the serde_json decode
moved +0.5% between `0303980` and `fd22977`, and nothing in its path changed.

**What the benches measure and how they can mislead** is written at the top of each bench module
(`benches/sdk/*.rs`, `benches/loopback.rs`). In short: B1 to B5 time steady state (warm scratch, warm header map);
B3 rebuilds crate-private steps from the same parts and checks its body byte for byte against one a real call sent;
B5's transport answers at once, so it contains no network at all; B6 is loopback, an upper bound on one connection's
throughput and never a prediction for a network.

### B1 - encode (`fd22977`)

| Bench | macOS median | Linux median | Linux instructions (min-max of 3) |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `prepared[1 KB]` | 333.2 ns | 437.1 ns | 3,317-3,342 |
| `prepared[64 KB]` | 20.70 µs | 25.31 µs | 227,996-228,094 |
| `prepared[1 MB]` | 321.9 µs | 437.4 µs | 2,663,300-2,663,496 |
| `unprepared[1 KB]` | 603.9 ns | 824.6 ns | 7,140-7,540 |
| `unprepared[64 KB]` | 21.24 µs | 25.69 µs | 231,826-232,202 |
| `unprepared[1 MB]` | 322.4 µs | 436.6 µs | 2,667,191-2,667,462 |
| `object_1mb` | 321.6 µs | 427.4 µs | 2,664,122-2,664,139 |
| `mixed_sizes` (1 MB then 16 x 1 KB, fresh scratch) | 338.4 µs | 724.7 µs | 2,721,562-2,722,805 |

Preparing the three questions on every call instead of once costs 3,800 to 4,200 instructions at every size, which is
the whole difference between `unprepared` and `prepared`: 270 ns (macOS) and 390 ns (Linux) at 1 KB, and lost in the
spread at 64 KB and 1 MB.

### B2 - decode (`fd22977`)

| Bench | macOS median | Linux median | Linux instructions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `answers[3]` (`SystemOneResponse<Answers>`) | 1.541 µs | 2.304 µs | 23,323-24,271 |
| `answers[20]` | 11.29 µs | 17.65 µs | 184,731-185,630 |
| `typed` (`#[derive(QuestionSet)]` struct) | 1.260 µs | 2.331 µs | 22,982 |

### B3 - request assembly (`fd22977`)

| Bench | macOS median | Linux median | Linux instructions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `request` (encode 1 KB + retained body + header map + request) | 419.0 ns | 607.9 ns | 5,136-6,343 |
| `header_map_clone` (6 headers) | 44.97 ns | 119.9 ns | 674 |

### B4 - `Retry-After` and backoff (`fd22977`)

| Bench | macOS median | Linux median | Linux instructions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `retry_after[ms]` | 39.44 ns | 99.91 ns | 789-793 |
| `retry_after[seconds]` | 45.95 ns | 90.11 ns | 897 |
| `retry_after[date]` (includes `SystemTime::now()`) | 81.75 ns | 169.4 ns | 1,773 |
| `backoff[1]` | 112.3 ns | 247.9 ns | 2,672 |
| `backoff[6]` (capped) | 117.5 ns | 261.9 ns | 2,852 |
| `backoff[1000]` | 117.5 ns | 260.8 ns | 2,852 |

The backoff delay costs more than parsing a header because `round_to_millis` rounds exactly as Python's
`round(x, 3)` does, by formatting to three decimals and parsing back (no allocation). It runs once per retry, beside a
sleep of at least hundreds of milliseconds, and it is the frozen arithmetic of `retry.rs`: recorded, not changed.

### B5 - a whole call, its floor and the naive comparator (`fd22977`)

| Bench | macOS median | Linux median | Linux instructions |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `floor` (transport called directly, pre-built request) | 198.9 ns | 390.1 ns | 2,526 |
| `sdk` (3 questions, 1 KB state) | **2.395 µs** | **4.088 µs** | **33,964-34,174** |
| `naive` (comparator A, same transport) | 5.041 µs | 8.032 µs | 64,601-65,057 |
| `sdk_20` (20 questions, six 5-level scores) | 11.12 µs | 19.34 µs | 193,825-194,086 |
| `naive_20` | 25.49 µs | 45.85 µs | 422,759-426,347 |

The SDK's call costs 0.52x the naive client's instructions (0.46x with 20 questions): AC-P7's condition ("the
instruction count of the SDK full-call benchmark is lower than the naive comparator's") holds on this host. AC-P7
itself is proved only by a pull-request run of `bench.yaml` on CodSpeed's runner, which is the owner's to set up.

Comparator (B), the published `typesafe-rs` 0.1.0, was **not** measured: it is a new crate, which this phase does not
add. Measuring it would take adding it as a dev-dependency (a license and advisory check through `cargo deny`), and
it can only be compared if its client accepts a base URL, so that it can be pointed at the loopback TestServer rather
than at the live API.

### B6 - loopback HTTP/2 over TLS (`fd22977`, wall clock only)

| Bench | macOS median | Linux median |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| `sequential` (one call at a time, warm connection) | 57.88 µs | 89.60 µs |
| `concurrent_64` (64 calls spawned at once, until the last answers) | 1.539 ms | 1.621 ms |

64 concurrent calls take about 27x (macOS) and 18x (Linux) the time of one: they share one connection and one
server, and the loopback round trip is the floor of both.

### sonic-rs and serde_json, no flags (`fd22977`)

The SDK's own decoder cannot be pointed at serde_json (`codec.rs` is the only module naming a codec), so both parsers
decode the naive comparator's serde types from the same bytes, and both encode the same state string into a retained
buffer.

| Bench | macOS sonic-rs | macOS serde_json | Linux sonic-rs | Linux serde_json | Linux instr. sonic-rs | Linux instr. serde_json |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| decode, 3 answers | 1.208 µs | 1.405 µs | 2.124 µs | 2.252 µs | 21,448 | 27,110-27,115 |
| decode, 20 answers | 9.832 µs | 11.04 µs | 20.98 µs | 21.91 µs | 198,859-199,476 | 221,402-221,535 |
| encode, 1 KB | 296.6 ns | 510.1 ns | 373.1 ns | 805.2 ns | 2,589-2,657 | 11,161 |
| encode, 64 KB | 18.91 µs | 32.29 µs | 23.35 µs | 53.71 µs | 158,969 | 709,291 |
| encode, 1 MB | 305.1 µs | 518.9 µs | 376.3 µs | 844.9 µs | 2,542,539 | 11,347,676 |

**sonic-rs does not lose on the small-response decode (R3, decision D2):** 21% fewer instructions on the 3-answer
document, and faster on both machines. In wall-clock time on Linux x86_64 without `target-cpu` the gap is small and
was a tie in one run (2.187 µs against 2.193 µs at `0303980`), so the advantage there is in instructions rather than
in time. On encode sonic-rs is 1.7x (macOS) to 2.3x (Linux) faster and runs 4.3x to 4.5x fewer instructions.

### Candidates (Linux instructions against the run-to-run spread above; blocks from the dhat tests on macOS)

| # | Candidate | Result | Numbers | Decision |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `compact_str` 0.10.0 for the model, answer names, choice pick and option names | measured in the working tree only | decode 14 -> **7** blocks, 626 -> 578 bytes; derived 10 -> 6; a call's own 19 -> **12**; instructions: `answers[3]` -2.1%, `answers[20]` -8.5%, `call::sdk` -2.9%, nothing up | waited for a ruling (a new crate); **adopted** after the owner approved the dependency: `821d970`, see "`compact_str` for names" below |
| 2 | `Bytes`-slice zero-copy names (a crate-private `Text`: a slice of the retained body, or owned when escaped; the body reaches the visitors through a thread-local) | reverted | decode 14 -> 7 blocks but 626 -> **658** bytes (`Text` is 32 bytes, `String` 24); instructions: `answers[3]` **+2.4%** (within its 3.1% spread), `typed` **+2.5%** (a benchmark that repeats exactly), `answers[20]` -4.5%, `call::sdk` -1.4% | **reverted**: an instruction regression elsewhere. It would also make a kept answer pin the whole response body (up to 16 MiB), a behaviour change |
| 3 | dense instead of sparse score-level storage | not built: bounded by measurement | all of `insert_by_level` is 1.86% of `answers[3]` (3.94% of `answers[20]`) and vector growth 0.44% (1.20%), exclusive callgrind cost; a dense layout keeps one vector per list, so no block moves | **rejected**: even free storage could not reach 5% on B2, and dense storage cannot keep the documented "a level named twice keeps both entries" |
| 4 | pre-baked `,"model":...,"questions":...}` suffix | measured as a bench variant | `prepared[1 KB]` 3,356-3,400 against 3,331-3,384 now; 64 KB and 1 MB within 0.1%; 0 blocks either way | **reverted**: no gain; the four `extend_from_slice` calls it replaces are too cheap to see |
| 5 | call-future sizes against tokio's debug box threshold (v3.5 (1)) | **kept**, `7493955` + `fd22977` | every call's future -352 bytes: System One over a custom transport 2,392 -> **2,040** (under 2,048), models 2,080 -> 1,728; over hyper 2,760 -> 2,344 (still over) and 2,448 -> 2,032; an unpinned debug call 20 -> **19** blocks of its own; instructions unchanged within the spread | kept under v3.5 (1), which named exactly this block as the target ("shrink the futures if it is cheap"), not under the generic keep rule: it moved no instruction count and no pinned or release block, only the unpinned debug call's box (release was never boxed, 16,384) |
| 6 | score level lists sized from the questions asked (v3.5 (2): 5 to 8 levels cost a block) | **kept**, `06573d7` + `fd22977` | whole call, measured by a throwaway dhat test over a transport that allocates nothing: 20 questions with six 5-level scores 117 -> **111** blocks, 9,439 -> 8,095 bytes; 3 questions 19 -> 19 blocks, 2,728 -> 2,696 bytes (`alloc_call`'s whole call: 22 / 3,405 -> 22 / 3,373). `call::sdk_20` -1.3% instructions (ranges do not overlap) | kept. `06573d7` alone grew the future to 2,064 bytes and brought the debug box back; `fd22977` holds the context in two `u32`s and restores 2,040 |
| 7 | a hard ceiling on the retained scratch (R17), 1 MiB, in `codec.rs` | measured in the working tree only | AC-P1 at 1 MB: 1 -> **3** blocks, 1,092,608 -> **7,384,117** bytes per call (**fails AC-P1**); 1 KB and 64 KB unchanged. Time: `prepared[1 MB]` 433.0 -> 434.3 µs on Linux, 321.7 -> 326.4 µs on macOS; `mixed_sizes` 646 -> 444 µs (Linux); instructions within 1% | **proposal for the lead and the user** (R5(b), (d)): it caps the memory a thread keeps after a large body at 1 MiB instead of about 6x the body, costs no measurable time on either allocator, and turns AC-P1's 1 MB row from 1 block / 1.00x into 3 blocks / 6.8x |

Commands: candidates 1, 2, 5, 6 and 7 were applied as a patch to the Linux scratch checkout, built with
`cargo codspeed build` and counted with the callgrind command above, three runs each; their blocks come from
`cargo test --all-features --test alloc_decode --test alloc_call --test alloc_derive --test alloc_encode -- --nocapture`
on macOS, and candidate 6's 20-question call from a throwaway dhat test of the same shape (not committed). Candidate 3's
bound is `callgrind_annotate` on the `decode::answers` dumps of the baseline.

### Final AC-P1 / AC-P2 / AC-P3 / AC-P6 check (`fd22977`, macOS, budgets as frozen)

```sh
env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml test --all-features \
  --test alloc_encode --test alloc_decode --test alloc_derive --test alloc_call -- --nocapture
env -u RUSTFLAGS cargo --config ~/.config/rust/config.dev.toml test --release --all-features \
  --test alloc_encode --test alloc_decode --test alloc_derive --test alloc_call -- --nocapture
```

All four tests pass in both profiles, and every one of the 36 measured sections printed the **same five runs in the
dev and the release profile**:

| Criterion | Budget | Measured | Verdict |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AC-P1 encode, 1 KB / 64 KB / 1 MB string, 1 MB object | 1 block, bytes <= 1.05x body + 4 KiB | 1 block each, exactly the body length (1,408 / 68,608 / 1,092,608 / 1,092,696) | holds |
| AC-P1 retained scratch | <= 8x the decayed hint | 4.39x / 5.73x / 5.76x / 5.76x | holds |
| AC-P2 decode, 3 answers | <= 14 blocks, <= 700 bytes, <= 0.7x naive | 14 blocks, 626 bytes, 0.54x | holds, zero block headroom as before |
| AC-P3 derived | fewer than AC-P2 | 10 blocks / 347 bytes | holds |
| AC-P6 a call's own blocks | 19 (18 without retry) | 19 (18); 3,373 bytes where Phase 4 had 3,405 | holds |

The unpinned whole call now costs the same as the pinned one in the dev profile too (22 blocks), because the System
One future over this transport is 2,040 bytes, under tokio's debug box size; before `7493955` it cost 23.

### After the exit gate

The verifier (`p5-verify`, at `acd4df3`) found defects that were fixed forward; each entry names its commit.

**D1: the level hint is bounded (`ae65058`).** Candidate 6's hint is the largest score the request asked, and every
score answer's first level list started at it, empty ones included, with no bound: a server answering many score
answers turned it into memory. `AnswerContext::with_levels` now holds it to 8 (`MAX_LEVEL_HINT`: 5 to 8 levels is the
case the candidate targets), and a list reserves it only at its first entry, so an empty `{}` allocates nothing.
`tests/alloc_level_hint.rs` asks one score of 1,000 levels, answers 500 empty and 500 one-level scores (a 90,359 B
body), and holds what the response keeps to at most 2x what the same body keeps with no hint, which is what
`f99594e`, before the hint, keeps for both (170,902 B, measured there with the same test):

| Tree | Kept, no hint | Kept, 1,000 levels asked | Ratio |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `f99594e` | 170,902 B | 170,902 B | 1.00 |
| `acd4df3` | 170,902 B | 32,106,902 B | 187.9 (the test fails) |
| the clamp alone | 170,902 B | 362,902 B | 2.12 (the test fails) |
| `ae65058` | 170,902 B | 234,902 B | 1.37 |

The verifier's own probe, re-run on `ae65058`: its 20,002-answer empty flood keeps 2,295,425 B (exactly `f99594e`;
`acd4df3` kept 642,295,425 B), its one-level flood 793,393 B (`f99594e` 569,393 B, `acd4df3` 64,313,393 B), and its
12 wrong-hint cases decode to output identical to both trees. Nothing else moved: the 36 `alloc_*` sections are as
above in dev and release, the 20-question call is still 111 blocks / 8,299 B (a throwaway dhat test of candidate 6's
shape, five equal runs, dev and release), and the call futures are unchanged. Instructions, five runs each on the
Linux host (`acd4df3` -> `ae65058`): `typed` 22,982 -> 22,974, `call::sdk` 33,907-34,441 -> 33,645-34,256,
`call::sdk_20` 193,356-194,152 -> 193,001-193,656, `answers[3]` 23,219-23,928 -> 23,306-23,630, `answers[20]`
184,280-185,307 -> 183,771-184,993. Reserving at the first entry is free only in this form. Against `acd4df3`, five
runs each: the clamp alone cost `typed` +154 (23,136); the clamp with an emptiness check inside the loop cost `typed`
+194 (23,176, so the check itself +40 over the clamp alone) and `sdk_20` +0.4% (min 193,356 -> 194,150); and the
peeled loop with the hint bounded a second time inside the decoder cost `typed` +115 (23,097), because the decoder was
no longer inlined into its hint-0 wrapper. The committed form: `typed` -8 (22,974). The raw callgrind table these
rows come from was not kept (it lived in a temporary session directory); the `decode::typed` rows it held are these,
each the same in all five runs:

| Variant | Form | `decode::typed` Ir | Against base |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: |
| base | `acd4df3`, no clamp | 22,982 | 0 |
| a | the clamp alone | 23,136 | +154 |
| ab | the clamp and an emptiness check inside the loop | 23,176 | +194 |
| ac | the peeled loop, the hint bounded again inside the decoder | 23,097 | +115 |
| ad | the peeled loop, bounded once (committed in `ae65058`) | 22,974 | -8 |

**D5: observable changes of candidate 6, accepted.** `AnswerContext` (a public type): its `Debug` output gained the
field (`AnswerContext { expected_answers: 0, levels: 0 }`), its alignment went from 8 to 4 on 64-bit targets (the
size stays 8; it goes from 4 to 8 on 32-bit ones), and `Eq` and `Hash` now include the level hint, so contexts of
two requests can differ. `size_of::<PreparedQuestions>()` went from 64 to 72 bytes. No signature, no derive
expansion and no `PartialEq` result of `PreparedQuestions` changed, and no size was ever documented.

**D6: the future-size guard holds the property (`b0cd3f6`).** Its bounds (2,816 / 2,560) could not see tokio's
debug box threshold, which `06573d7` crossed unnoticed (2,064 bytes). Futures over a custom transport are now
asserted <= 2,048 on every platform; futures over the default transport at the sizes measured on macOS arm64 and
Linux x86_64 (2,344 / 2,328 / 2,328 / 2,032, identical on both, dev and release) plus 32 bytes. Targets other than
macOS and Linux (Windows among them) keep the old bounds: they have not been measured.

**CI (`5a51d1f`):** the feature-powerset step runs clippy with warnings denied instead of `cargo hack check`, so a
lint in any of the ten combinations between none and all fails CI. **D8 (`0749117`):** the unused `divan` entry is
gone from `[workspace.dependencies]`; `Cargo.lock` did not change. **D4, D7, N1** are wording fixes in
`benches/sdk/decode.rs`, `__internals`, and `transport/mod.rs`.

**R17: an 8 MiB ceiling on the retained encode scratch (`codec.rs`, `MAX_RETAINED_SCRATCH`).** Candidate 7 at
1 MiB failed AC-P1's 1 MB rows. A thread kept six times the largest string state it ever encoded, without bound (a
64 MiB state left 402,653,228 B on its thread), released only by later calls on that same thread. A scratch over
8 MiB is now dropped after its call. Every frozen AC-P1 row needs a ceiling of at least 6,291,587 B (the 1 MB object
row's scratch; 6 MiB fails it), so 8 MiB leaves every row as it was: the 20 `alloc_encode` sections print the same
five runs as at `acd4df3`, in dev and in release (diffed). A state whose scratch passes the ceiling (a string over
about 1.33 MiB) pays on every call what a first call pays. B1 gained a 4 MiB row for that case (`prepared[4194304]`);
its wall clock with the ceiling against without it, three runs of 100 samples each, medians:

| Machine | Without the ceiling | With it | Change |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| macOS arm64 (load average 6 to 10) | 1.270-1.274 ms | 1.272-1.279 ms | +0.3% |
| Linux x86_64, `taskset -c 2` | 1.813-1.819 ms | 1.871-1.872 ms | +2.9% |

The 1 KB, 64 KB and 1 MB rows moved by less than 1% on both machines. The unit tests
`a_scratch_past_the_ceiling_is_not_kept` (a 2 MiB state keeps 0 B after each of three calls) and
`a_scratch_under_the_ceiling_is_kept` (a 1 MiB state keeps its scratch) pin the rule.

### `compact_str` for names (`821d970`)

Candidate 1, adopted after the owner approved the dependency (`compact_str` 0.10.0, `default-features = false`,
`features = ["std"]`; its `serde` feature is not used). The model name, the answer names, a choice's pick and its
option names are a crate-private `Name` (`src/name.rs`), which stores up to 24 bytes inline on a 64-bit target. The
legend descriptions are `Content` and did not change. `src/name.rs` is the only file that names the crate: the unit
test `only_this_module_names_the_small_string_crate` reads every `.rs` file under `src`, `tests`, `benches` and
`crates` and fails on any other file that does. Swapping the crate out, or going back to `String`, is a change to that
file alone. `Name` decodes through a visitor of its own (`visit_str`, `visit_string`), so the decode never builds a
`String` first.

Nothing public moved: accessors return `&str`, `ChoiceAnswer::new` and `Answers: FromIterator` take `Into<String>`,
and `size_of` is 216 / 24 / 64 / 56 bytes for `SystemOneResponse<Answers>` / `Answers` / `Answer` / `ChoiceAnswer`
before and after (pinned in `tests/static_assertions.rs` for 64-bit targets, `Option` of the last two included). The
test `long_multi_byte_and_escaped_names_decode_serialize_and_print_as_text` decodes names of 24 and 25 bytes,
multi-byte names of 15, 27 and 33 bytes, and names written with escapes. It checks that serializing writes the body
back byte for byte, through the codec and through serde_json, and pins the `Debug` output. The same test, run at
`521736d`, passes with the same expected strings.

**Accepted: a blanket impl on public rustdoc pages.** `compact_str` has
`impl<T: Display + ?Sized> ToCompactString for T`, so rustdoc lists it under "Blanket Implementations" on the 7 public
types that implement `Display`: `ApiError`, `DecodeError`, `EncodeError`, `Error`, `RawJson`,
`ResponseValidationError` and `ContentError`. It is the only difference between the rustdoc JSON of `521736d` and
`ca5f02e` (the Phase 5 verifier's diff, 775 public items each). It cannot be avoided while depending on the crate,
it is the same class as the `tracing` (`Instrument`, `WithSubscriber`) and `zerocopy` blanket impls already listed
there, and it is no API the SDK commits to: no SDK item names the trait.

**Accepted: names of 25 to 31 bytes keep a little more memory.** `compact_str`'s heap buffer holds at least 32 bytes
where a `String` holds exactly its length, so a name just past the inline limit keeps a few more bytes. The Phase 5
verifier's probe, 2,000 answers with three such names each: 628,248 B kept against 588,258 B at `521736d` (+6.8%),
while the blocks fall from 10,003 to 8,002. At 40 and 100 bytes, and for names written with escapes, the tree keeps
the same or less.

**Blocks** (macOS, `alloc_*` tests, five runs each, identical in the dev and the release profile):

| Section | `521736d` | `821d970` |
| --- | ---: | ---: |
| AC-P2 decode, 3 answers (blocks / bytes) | 14 / 626 | **7 / 578** |
| AC-P2 ratio to the naive comparator (26 / 2,672) | 0.54 | **0.27** |
| AC-P3 derived set, hand-written and derived | 10 / 347 | **6 / 314** |
| AC-P6 a call's own blocks (no retry) | 19 (18) | **12 (11)** |
| whole call, pinned or unpinned (no retry) | 22 / 3,373 (21 / 3,349) | 15 / 3,325 (14 / 3,301) |
| AC-P1 encode rows, `mixed` rows, transport, header map | unchanged | unchanged |

The budgets were tightened to the measurements; none was loosened, and `RUNS` / `AGREE` did not change. The tightened
values are: `alloc_decode` `MAX_BLOCKS` 14 -> 7 and, after the verifier's review, `MAX_BYTES` 700 -> 650 (`03ee23f`:
578 plus 12.5%, close to the 11.8% the first bound had over 626; 700 had left 21%),
`alloc_derive` `ANSWERS_BUDGET` 14 -> 7 and `HAND_WRITTEN_BLOCKS` 10 -> 6, and `alloc_call` `MAX_BLOCKS` 19 -> 12 and
`MAX_BLOCKS_WITHOUT_RETRY` 18 -> 11. AC-P3 is still "fewer blocks than AC-P2": 6 against 7. All of these are 64-bit
numbers, as the budgets always were. On a 32-bit target the inline limit is 12 bytes: the fixture's names still fit,
but a longer name costs a block there that it does not cost here.

**Instructions** (Linux host, callgrind `Ir` as under Method, five runs of the whole `sdk` target per tree, min-max
with the spread as a share of the min):

| Benchmark | `521736d` | `821d970` | Change of the min |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| `decode::answers[3]` | 23,368-24,091 (3.1%) | 22,886-23,110 (1.0%) | **-2.1%**, ranges apart |
| `decode::answers[20]` | 183,795-185,041 (0.7%) | 169,898-170,586 (0.4%) | **-7.6%**, ranges apart |
| `decode::typed` | 22,957 (0.0%) | 22,883 (0.0%) | -0.3% |
| `call::sdk` | 34,000-34,216 (0.6%) | 32,628-33,446 (2.5%) | **-4.0%**, ranges apart |
| `call::sdk_20` | 193,459-194,334 (0.5%) | 178,336-179,081 (0.4%) | **-7.8%**, ranges apart |
| `call::naive` / `call::floor` | 64,663-66,198 / 2,526 | 64,629-66,595 / 2,526 | overlap / 0 |

No other benchmark's range lies above its old range, apart from two that do not reach a name.
`retry::retry_after[seconds]` goes from 897 to 898 and `retry_after[date]` from 1,773 to 1,774 (+1 instruction,
+0.1%, in all five runs). Their per-function counts show where: `http`'s `HdrName::from_bytes` (102 + 75 -> 101 + 76)
and one more instruction elsewhere in the `http` header lookup. That is the code-layout effect of a rebuild described
under Method, not code this change runs. The encode, assembly and retry benchmarks overlap their old ranges.

Commands: the alloc tests as under "Final AC-P1 / AC-P2 / AC-P3 / AC-P6 check", at `521736d` and at `821d970`, dev
and release. On the Linux host there were two scratch clones, one at `521736d` and one with `821d970`'s diff applied.
Each was built with `cargo codspeed build -m simulation -p typesafe-sdk-rust --features internals --bench sdk`, and
the callgrind command under Method was run on each tree five times, pinned to one core, one run at a time. Both
clones were removed afterwards.

### AC-P7: proven on CodSpeed's runner

| Item | Evidence |
| --- | --- |
| First pull-request run (`ca5f02e`) | run 35428694878: build ok, then CodSpeed's runner stopped with "Unsupported system" on `ubuntu-26.04`. Its valgrind setup accepts Ubuntu 22.04 / 24.04 and Debian 12 only (`CodSpeedHQ/runner`, `src/executor/valgrind/setup.rs`, runner 5.2.1 and 5.3.1) |
| Image pin | `a5a0795`: the `codspeed` job alone runs on `ubuntu-24.04`, the newest GitHub-hosted image the runner supports, with the reason and the condition for going back beside the label (wording made exact in `15952c4`) |
| Proof | run 35429672326 at `a5a0795`, on `ubuntu-24.04`: 35 benchmarks measured, uploaded through OIDC, and CodSpeed's check reports the app installed. `call::sdk` 108.8 µs against `call::naive` 159.3 µs (**0.68x**), `call::sdk_20` 233 µs against `call::naive_20` 511.3 µs (**0.46x**). These are CodSpeed's simulated times (instruction counts with its cache and cycle estimate), checked by the Phase 5 verifier, not measured on the Linux host |
| `push` trigger | added after that run: `bench.yaml` now also runs on every push to `main`, the baseline CodSpeed compares pull requests with. A `main` run is never cancelled by a newer one (`cancel-in-progress` is off for `refs/heads/main`, as in `ci.yaml`) |

AC-P7's condition, "the instruction count of the SDK full-call benchmark is lower than the naive comparator's", holds on
CodSpeed's runner as it held on the Linux host (0.51x to 0.52x in raw instructions there). CodSpeed reports estimated
times rather than raw instructions, so its ratios are not expected to equal the host's; why the 3-question ratio is
higher there (0.68x) was not measured.

### Unmeasured

- Instruction counts on arm64 (callgrind is not available for macOS arm64).
- Comparator (B), `typesafe-rs` 0.1.0 (a new crate).
- Wall-clock numbers on an idle macOS machine: every macOS table here was taken under a load average of 8 to 15 from
  other sessions.
- Instruction counts of `loopback` (kept out of the instrumented run on purpose).
- The R17 ceiling at any value other than 1 MiB and 8 MiB, and under a musl or jemalloc allocator.
- The name budgets on a 32-bit target (inline limit 12 bytes), and `compact_str`'s instruction counts on arm64.
- Future sizes on targets other than macOS and Linux (the size guard keeps loose bounds there).

## Phase 6 - hardening

### F1: a body that is not UTF-8 is refused before the parser reads it (`ab5c4b3`)

**What.** Fuzzing `decode_response` found, after 41 executions, that bytes that are not UTF-8 inside a JSON string
reached sonic-rs 0.5.10's `as_str` (`src/parser.rs:104`), which is a `debug_assert!` followed by
`from_utf8_unchecked`: a panic with debug assertions, an invalid `&str` handed to serde without them. `from_slice`
records the first bad byte up front but raises the error only after deserialization has finished. The SDK reached it
through the error-body reader (any non-2xx whose `RawJson` members hold such a string) and through the path-tracking
second pass of `decode_seed` (a 200 whose score legend value is an object).

**Where and the fix.** `src/codec.rs`: `as_text`, one `std::str::from_utf8` (no allocation) at the two places every
body enters the codec, `decode` and `decode_seed`, before the depth pre-scan. The checked `&str` then goes to
`sonic_rs::from_str` / `Deserializer::from_str`, which skip sonic's own UTF-8 pass, and `describe_failure` takes the
same `&str`. So a body is validated once: a `decode_seed` body was validated twice before. A failure is a
`DecodeErrorKind::Syntax` at the first bad byte.

**Cost, as measured.**

- Allocations: the five `alloc_*` tests pass unchanged; no budget or assertion moved. The check allocates nothing.
- Wall clock, divan on macOS arm64 (`cargo bench --features internals,macros --bench sdk`), two alternating rounds
  per tree (fix, base, fix, base), one at a time. Medians:

  | Bench | fix r1 / r2 | base r1 / r2 | Delta range |
  | --- | --- | --- | --- |
  | `decode::answers[3]` | 1.332 / 1.291 us | 1.322 / 1.270 us | +0.8 to +1.7% |
  | `decode::answers[20]` | 9.999 / 9.666 us | 9.729 / 9.249 us | +2.8 to +4.5% |
  | `decode::typed` | 1.239 / 1.207 us | 1.291 / 1.239 us | -2.6 to -4.0% |
  | `call::sdk` | 2.291 / 2.270 us | 2.291 / 2.207 us | 0 to +2.9% |

  Round-to-round drift within one tree reaches 4.9% (base `answers[20]`: 9.729 to 9.249 us), so none of these moves
  is resolved.

**Not measured.** Instruction counts on the Linux host: none were taken, and the host was retired, so CodSpeed's run is
the Linux evidence. The expected delta is small (std's UTF-8 pass replaces sonic's for most bodies). Nor was any
fuzzing done on x86_64, where sonic-rs picks other SIMD paths.
