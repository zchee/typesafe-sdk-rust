//! What the tests against the live TypeSafe API share.
//!
//! **These tests make real, billed calls.** They run only when BOTH
//! `TYPESAFE_LIVE_TESTS=1` and `TYPESAFE_API_KEY` are in the environment; then
//! `cargo test --workspace`, `cargo nextest run --workspace` or any command
//! naming `-p typesafe-sdk-rust-live-tests` sends requests to the live API on
//! that key's account. A key alone is not enough, so a contributor who has one
//! exported for other work is not billed by a stray `--workspace`. This crate
//! is a workspace member (so its code is linted and compiled) but not a
//! default member: a plain `cargo test` or `cargo nextest run` never builds or
//! runs it. Run it on purpose, with a key meant for it.
//!
//! The tests themselves are in `tests/live.rs`. Each one builds its client
//! through [`live_client`], which panics when either variable is missing,
//! before any client is built or any request is made, so such a run fails
//! with a message naming both variables instead of passing without having
//! asked the API anything.
