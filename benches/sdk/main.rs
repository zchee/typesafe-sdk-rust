//! CPU benchmarks of the SDK's own work, with no I/O: body encode (B1),
//! response decode (B2), request assembly (B3), `Retry-After` and backoff
//! (B4), and a whole call through an in-memory service against its floor and
//! against a naive client (B5).
//!
//! Everything here is deterministic and single-threaded, so it is what the
//! CodSpeed instrumented run measures. Loopback I/O lives in the `loopback`
//! target instead, because an instruction count of a socket round trip
//! measures the kernel and the scheduler as much as the SDK.
//!
//! Run with `cargo bench --all-features --bench sdk`, with no `RUSTFLAGS`:
//! the numbers are meant to be what a consumer's default build gets.

// The CodSpeed layer is used under divan's own name, as its documentation
// asks: its attribute macros expand to paths that start with `::divan`. A
// dependency inherited from the workspace cannot be renamed in the manifest,
// so the rename happens here; `extern crate ... as` puts the new name in
// the extern prelude, where a `::divan` path looks.
